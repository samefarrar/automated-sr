# checkpoint-receptors-aih-protocol.yaml

name: checkpoint-receptors-aih

objective: |
  To systematically review the evidence on whether inhibitory checkpoint
  receptors (BTLA, CTLA-4, PD-1, TIGIT, VISTA, LAG-3, CD200R) and their
  ligands are involved in the pathogenesis of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH),
  including their expression patterns, functional roles, genetic associations,
  and potential as therapeutic targets.

inclusion_criteria:
  - Original research articles (human or animal studies)
  - Studies examining expression, function, or genetic variants of BTLA, CTLA-4, PD-1, TIGIT, VISTA, LAG-3, or CD200R
  - Studies in patients with autoimmune hepatitis or animal models of AIH
  - Studies comparing AIH to healthy controls or other liver disease controls
  - Published in English

exclusion_criteria:
  - Conference abstracts without full text
  - Review articles, editorials, commentaries, letters without original data
  - Case reports with fewer than 3 patients
  - Studies exclusively on checkpoint inhibitor drug-induced liver injury (ICI-DILI)
  - Studies on primary biliary cholangitis or primary sclerosing cholangitis without AIH comparison
