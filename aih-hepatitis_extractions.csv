No formal sample size justification provided","Yes - AIH diagnosed using International Autoimmune Hepatitis Group criteria, all patients had ANA, histological confirmation","Yes - multiple control groups including healthy controls for PBMC, and disease controls (chronic hepatitis C, fatty liver) for LIMC",CD80; CD86; CD152,peripheral blood; liver tissue,Human,Cross-sectional comparative study,True,"Authors suggest that anti-CD86 antibody or soluble CTLA-4 (CD152) might be used to stabilize liver function for treatment of AIH, similar to approaches used in other autoimmune diseases.","Mixed (some on corticosteroids, some treatment-naive)"
