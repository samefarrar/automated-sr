164,+49A/G polymorphism of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 gene in type 1 autoimmune hepatitis and primary biliary cirrhosis: A meta-analysis.,,,10.1111/j.1872-034X.2010.00757.x,include,"Let me evaluate this citation systematically against the inclusion and exclusion criteria:

**Checking Inclusion Criteria:**

1. **Original research articles**: The title indicates this is a ""meta-analysis,"" which is a systematic synthesis of multiple studies. This needs careful consideration.

2. **Studies examining expression, function, or genetic variants of checkpoint receptors**: YES - The study examines the +49A/G polymorphism of CTLA-4 (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4), which is one of the specified checkpoint receptors.

3. **Studies in patients with autoimmune hepatitis**: YES - The title explicitly mentions ""type 1 autoimmune hepatitis.""

4. **Studies comparing AIH to healthy controls or other liver disease controls**: Likely YES - Meta-analyses typically include such comparisons, though this cannot be confirmed without the abstract.

5. **Published in English**: Cannot confirm, but title is in English.

**Checking Exclusion Criteria:**

1. **Conference abstracts without full text**: Cannot determine from the information provided.

2. **Review articles, editorials, commentaries, letters without original data**: POTENTIAL ISSUE - This is a meta-analysis. Meta-analyses are typically considered secondary research that synthesizes original data from multiple studies. However, meta-analyses do contain original statistical analyses and are often considered valuable evidence. The exclusion criterion specifically mentions ""review articles"" and ""without original data.""

3. **Case reports with fewer than 3 patients**: Not applicable.

4. **Studies exclusively on checkpoint inhibitor drug-induced liver injury**: NO - This is about genetic polymorphisms, not drug-induced injury.

5. **Studies on PBC or PSC without AIH comparison**: The title mentions both AIH and PBC, so AIH is included.

**Key Consideration:**
The main question is whether a meta-analysis should be excluded as a ""review article."" Meta-analyses are systematic reviews with quantitative synthesis, and while they don't generate primary data, they provide original statistical analyses of pooled data. The protocol's exclusion of ""review articles"" likely refers to narrative reviews rather than systematic reviews/meta-analyses, which are considered high-quality evidence. Given the instruction to ""lean towards INCLUDE to avoid missing potentially relevant studies,"" and that this meta-analysis directly addresses CTLA-4 genetic variants in AIH (a core topic of the review), inclusion seems appropriate.",anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929,2026-01-28T07:22:54.316395
311,A Potential New Use for Tocilizumab: Refractory Checkpoint Inhibitor Hepatitis.,,,10.14309/crj.0000000000001162,exclude,"1. **Document Type Assessment**: The title suggests this is likely a case report or case series about using tocilizumab (an IL-6 receptor antagonist) for checkpoint inhibitor-induced hepatitis.

2. **Topic Relevance**:
   - The study is about ""checkpoint inhibitor hepatitis"" which refers to drug-induced liver injury from immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy (ICI-DILI)
   - This is NOT about autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) as a primary disease entity
   - The focus appears to be on treatment of ICI-DILI rather than the pathogenesis of AIH

3. **Exclusion Criteria Application**:
   - **Exclusion Criterion #4** specifically states: ""Studies exclusively on checkpoint inhibitor drug-induced liver injury (ICI-DILI)"" should be excluded
   - This citation appears to fall directly under this exclusion criterion
   - The title indicates this is about ""checkpoint inhibitor hepatitis"" (ICI-DILI), not autoimmune hepatitis

4. **Inclusion Criteria Assessment**:
   - The study does not appear to examine AIH patients or AIH animal models (Criterion #3)
   - It does not appear to compare AIH to controls (Criterion #4)
   - While it mentions checkpoint inhibitors, it's about adverse effects of checkpoint inhibitor drugs, not about the role of checkpoint receptors in AIH pathogenesis

5. **Abstract Availability**: No abstract is available, but the title is sufficiently clear to indicate this is about ICI-DILI treatment, not AIH pathogenesis.",anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929,2026-01-28T07:23:03.097116
155,A case with hepatic immune-related adverse events caused by nivolumab exhibiting impaired accumulation of regulatory T cells.,,,10.1007/s12328-020-01317-y,exclude,"Let me evaluate this citation systematically against the inclusion and exclusion criteria:

1. **Publication type**: The title indicates this is ""A case with..."" which suggests this is a case report. According to exclusion criterion #3, case reports with fewer than 3 patients are excluded.

2. **Subject matter**: The title clearly indicates this is about ""hepatic immune-related adverse events caused by nivolumab."" Nivolumab is a checkpoint inhibitor drug (anti-PD-1 therapy), and the study is specifically about drug-induced liver injury from this checkpoint inhibitor.

3. **Exclusion criterion #4**: Studies exclusively on checkpoint inhibitor drug-induced liver injury (ICI-DILI) are explicitly excluded. This case appears to be exactly that - a case of liver injury caused by nivolumab (a checkpoint inhibitor).

4. **Autoimmune hepatitis focus**: The title does not mention autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). While immune-related adverse events from checkpoint inhibitors can sometimes mimic AIH, this appears to be specifically about drug-induced hepatotoxicity, not primary AIH.

5. **Abstract availability**: No abstract is available, but the title is sufficiently clear to make a determination.

The study appears to meet two exclusion criteria:
- It is a case report (likely fewer than 3 patients based on ""A case"" in the title)
- It is exclusively about checkpoint inhibitor drug-induced liver injury (ICI-DILI)",anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929,2026-01-28T07:23:11.169668
159,A different type of acute myocarditis: a case report of acute autoimmune myocarditis mediated by anti-PD-1 T lymphocyte receptor (pembrolizumab).,,,10.1093/ehjcr/ytaa214,exclude,"1. **Study Type Assessment**: The title indicates this is a ""case report"" of a single patient with acute autoimmune myocarditis.

2. **Topic Relevance**: The study is about myocarditis (heart inflammation), not autoimmune hepatitis (liver inflammation). The focus is on cardiac complications, not liver disease.

3. **Checkpoint Inhibitor Context**: The study involves pembrolizumab (anti-PD-1 therapy), which is a checkpoint inhibitor drug. The title suggests this is about drug-induced myocarditis from checkpoint inhibitor therapy.

4. **Application of Exclusion Criteria**:
   - **Exclusion Criterion #3**: ""Case reports with fewer than 3 patients"" - This appears to be a single case report, which would be excluded.
   - **Exclusion Criterion #4**: ""Studies exclusively on checkpoint inhibitor drug-induced liver injury (ICI-DILI)"" - While this criterion specifically mentions liver injury, the spirit of this exclusion is to exclude drug-induced autoimmune conditions from checkpoint inhibitor therapy rather than studies about the pathogenesis of primary autoimmune hepatitis. This case is about drug-induced myocarditis (heart), not liver disease at all.

5. **Application of Inclusion Criteria**:
   - **Criterion #3**: ""Studies in patients with autoimmune hepatitis or animal models of AIH"" - This study is about myocarditis, not hepatitis. It does not meet this fundamental inclusion criterion.

6. **Relevance to Review Objective**: The review is specifically about checkpoint receptors in the pathogenesis of autoimmune hepatitis. This case report is about a cardiac complication from checkpoint inhibitor therapy and does not address AIH.",anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929,2026-01-28T07:23:20.730181
170,A multireferral centre retrospective cohort analysis on the experience in treatment of metastatic uveal melanoma and utilization of sequential  liver-directed treatment and immunotherapy.,,,10.1097/CMR.0000000000000343,exclude,"1. **Study Topic Assessment**: The title clearly indicates this study is about metastatic uveal melanoma (a type of eye cancer) and its treatment with liver-directed therapy and immunotherapy.

2. **Relevance to Review Objective**: The systematic review is focused on inhibitory checkpoint receptors in autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). This citation is about:
   - Cancer (uveal melanoma), not autoimmune hepatitis
   - Cancer treatment with immunotherapy, not the pathogenesis or treatment of AIH
   - Liver-directed treatment for metastatic disease, not autoimmune liver disease

3. **Disease Condition Mismatch**:
   - Target condition: Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH)
   - Citation condition: Metastatic uveal melanoma with liver metastases
   - These are completely different disease entities

4. **Checkpoint Inhibitor Context**: While the study mentions immunotherapy (which may include checkpoint inhibitors), this appears to be in the context of:
   - Checkpoint inhibitor drugs as cancer treatment
   - Not studying the checkpoint receptors themselves in AIH pathogenesis
   - This would fall under exclusion criterion #4 if it were about drug-induced liver injury, but it's actually about treating cancer

5. **Application of Exclusion Criteria**: This study does not meet the basic inclusion criteria as it:
   - Is not about autoimmune hepatitis
   - Is not examining checkpoint receptors in the context of AIH pathogenesis
   - Studies cancer treatment, not autoimmune liver disease",anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929,2026-01-28T07:23:29.437927
210,A murine model of type 2 autoimmune hepatitis: Xenoimmunization with human antigens.,,,10.1002/hep.20109,include,"Let me evaluate this citation systematically against the inclusion and exclusion criteria:

**Analyzing Inclusion Criteria:**

1. **Original research articles (human or animal studies)**: The title indicates this is a study describing ""a murine model,"" which suggests original research in animals. ✓

2. **Studies examining expression, function, or genetic variants of checkpoint receptors**: The abstract is not available, so I cannot confirm whether the study examines any of the specific checkpoint receptors (BTLA, CTLA-4, PD-1, TIGIT, VISTA, LAG-3, or CD200R). However, the title alone does not mention these markers. ?

3. **Studies in patients with AIH or animal models of AIH**: The title explicitly mentions ""type 2 autoimmune hepatitis"" and describes a ""murine model,"" which clearly fits this criterion. ✓

4. **Studies comparing AIH to healthy controls or other liver disease controls**: Cannot determine from title alone. ?

5. **Published in English**: The title is in English, suggesting the article is in English. ✓

**Analyzing Exclusion Criteria:**

1. **Conference abstracts without full text**: Cannot determine from the information provided. ?

2. **Review articles, editorials, commentaries, letters without original data**: The title suggests this is an original research article describing a model, not a review or commentary. ✓ (not excluded)

3. **Case reports with fewer than 3 patients**: This is an animal model study, not a case report. ✓ (not excluded)

4. **Studies exclusively on checkpoint inhibitor drug-induced liver injury**: No indication of this from the title. ✓ (not excluded)

5. **Studies on PBC or PSC without AIH comparison**: The study is specifically about AIH (type 2), not PBC or PSC. ✓ (not excluded)

**Key Considerations:**

- The abstract is not available, making it impossible to confirm whether checkpoint receptors are examined
- The study is clearly about an AIH animal model, which is relevant to the review
- Following the instruction to ""lean towards INCLUDE to avoid missing potentially relevant studies (high sensitivity approach)"" when information is insufficient
- Animal models of AIH are often used to study immune mechanisms, including checkpoint receptors, so there is reasonable potential this study could be relevant",anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929,2026-01-28T07:23:40.199428
226,A phase 1b trial of the CXCR4 inhibitor mavorixafor and nivolumab in advanced renal cell carcinoma patients with no prior response to nivolumab monotherapy.,,,10.1007/s10637-020-01058-2,exclude,"1. **Study Type Assessment**: The title indicates this is a phase 1b clinical trial, which would be an original research article if it contains original data.

2. **Disease Focus**: The study is clearly focused on ""advanced renal cell carcinoma"" (kidney cancer), not autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). This is a completely different disease entity.

3. **Checkpoint Receptor Relevance**: While the study does mention nivolumab (which is a PD-1 inhibitor, one of the checkpoint receptors in our inclusion criteria), the study is examining it as a therapeutic agent for cancer, not studying its role in AIH pathogenesis.

4. **Primary Intervention**: The main focus appears to be on CXCR4 inhibitor (mavorixafor) combined with nivolumab for cancer treatment, not investigating checkpoint receptors in the context of autoimmune hepatitis.

5. **Exclusion Criteria Check**:
   - This is not about autoimmune hepatitis or AIH animal models (fails inclusion criterion #3)
   - This is a cancer immunotherapy study, not an autoimmune liver disease study
   - While it involves a checkpoint inhibitor drug, it's being used to treat cancer, not being studied in the context of AIH

6. **Inclusion Criteria Check**: The study fails the fundamental requirement of being related to autoimmune hepatitis (criterion #3).",anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929,2026-01-28T07:23:48.370481
259,ACG Clinical Guideline: Diagnosis and Management of Idiosyncratic Drug-Induced Liver Injury.,,,10.14309/ajg.0000000000001259,exclude,"1. **Document Type Assessment**: The title indicates this is a ""Clinical Guideline"" from the American College of Gastroenterology (ACG). Clinical guidelines are typically excluded under the protocol as they are not original research articles but rather synthesized recommendations based on existing evidence.

2. **Topic Relevance**: The guideline focuses on ""Idiosyncratic Drug-Induced Liver Injury"" (DILI), which is distinct from autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). While there can be overlap in clinical presentation, DILI is a separate entity from AIH.

3. **Checkpoint Inhibitor Context**: The exclusion criteria specifically mention ""Studies exclusively on checkpoint inhibitor drug-induced liver injury (ICI-DILI)"" should be excluded. While this guideline appears to be about idiosyncratic DILI broadly (not specifically ICI-DILI), it still focuses on drug-induced liver injury rather than autoimmune hepatitis.

4. **Inclusion Criteria Match**:
   - Not an original research article (fails criterion #1)
   - No indication it examines the specific checkpoint receptors listed (fails criterion #2)
   - Not specifically about AIH patients or animal models (fails criterion #3)

5. **Abstract Availability**: No abstract is available, which would normally suggest caution. However, the title is sufficiently clear that this is a clinical guideline about DILI, not original research on checkpoint receptors in AIH.",anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929,2026-01-28T07:23:56.383521
204,Abnormal membrane-bound and soluble programmed death ligand 2 (PD-L2) expression in systemic lupus erythematosus is associated with disease activity.,,,10.1016/j.imlet.2020.09.001,exclude,"1. **Study Population**: The title clearly indicates this study is about systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), not autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). SLE is a different autoimmune disease that primarily affects multiple organ systems but is not the liver-specific autoimmune condition that is the focus of this review.

2. **Checkpoint Molecule**: The study examines PD-L2 (programmed death ligand 2), which is a ligand for PD-1. While PD-1 is one of the checkpoint receptors listed in the inclusion criteria, the study must also meet the disease criteria.

3. **Disease Relevance**: The inclusion criteria specifically require:
   - Studies in patients with autoimmune hepatitis or animal models of AIH (Criterion 3)
   - Studies comparing AIH to healthy controls or other liver disease controls (Criterion 4)

   This study focuses on SLE, not AIH, and there is no indication in the title that it includes AIH patients or makes any comparison to AIH.

4. **Exclusion Criteria Check**: While the study doesn't fall under the specific exclusion categories listed (conference abstract, review article, case report, ICI-DILI, PBC/PSC), it fails to meet the fundamental inclusion criteria of being about autoimmune hepatitis.

5. **Abstract Availability**: The abstract is not available, but the title is sufficiently clear about the disease focus (SLE) to make a determination.",anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929,2026-01-28T07:24:04.485668
171,Accelerated Progression of Hepatocellular Carcinoma during Immunosuppressive Therapy with Abatacept for Rheumatoid Arthritis.,,,10.2169/internalmedicine.0843-18,exclude,"Let me evaluate this citation systematically against the inclusion and exclusion criteria:

**Analyzing the title:**
- The study is about ""Accelerated Progression of Hepatocellular Carcinoma during Immunosuppressive Therapy with Abatacept for Rheumatoid Arthritis""
- Abatacept is a CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein that blocks CD80/CD86 interaction with CD28, thereby modulating T-cell activation (related to CTLA-4 pathway, which is one of the checkpoint receptors of interest)
- However, the primary focus appears to be on:
  1. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) - not autoimmune hepatitis (AIH)
  2. Rheumatoid arthritis treatment - not AIH
  3. An adverse event (HCC progression) during immunosuppressive therapy

**Checking against inclusion criteria:**
1. Original research article - unclear from title alone, but likely a case report given the specific clinical scenario described
2. Studies examining CTLA-4 pathway - Yes, Abatacept is CTLA-4 related
3. Studies in AIH patients or animal models - NO - this is about rheumatoid arthritis and HCC
4. Studies comparing AIH to controls - NO
5. Published in English - Unknown but assumed

**Checking against exclusion criteria:**
1. Conference abstract - Unknown
2. Review/editorial/commentary - Unlikely given the specific clinical scenario
3. Case report with <3 patients - Likely a case report based on the title
4. Studies exclusively on checkpoint inhibitor drug-induced liver injury - This appears to be about HCC progression, not AIH or drug-induced liver injury
5. Studies on PBC/PSC without AIH - Not applicable

**Key issues:**
- The study is NOT about autoimmune hepatitis - it's about rheumatoid arthritis and hepatocellular carcinoma
- While it involves a CTLA-4-related drug, the disease context (rheumatoid arthritis, HCC) does not match the review's focus on AIH
- No abstract is available to confirm whether AIH is discussed",anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929,2026-01-28T07:24:16.641054
166,An 18-year-old woman with pulmonary nodules found to have cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 deficiency.,,,10.1136/bcr-2019-231600,exclude,"Let me evaluate this citation systematically against the inclusion and exclusion criteria:

**Assessing Inclusion Criteria:**
1. Original research articles - The title suggests this may be a case report describing a patient
2. Studies examining CTLA-4 - Yes, the title specifically mentions ""cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 deficiency"" (CTLA-4 is one of the checkpoint receptors of interest)
3. Studies in AIH patients or animal models - Unknown from title alone; no mention of autoimmune hepatitis
4. Comparison to controls - Cannot determine from title
5. Published in English - Title is in English

**Assessing Exclusion Criteria:**
1. Conference abstracts without full text - Cannot determine publication type from title alone
2. Review articles, editorials, etc. - The phrasing ""An 18-year-old woman with..."" suggests a case presentation rather than a review
3. Case reports with fewer than 3 patients - This appears to be a single patient case (n=1), which would meet this exclusion criterion
4. Studies exclusively on ICI-DILI - This appears to be about CTLA-4 deficiency (a genetic condition), not drug-induced liver injury
5. Studies on PBC/PSC without AIH - Cannot determine from title

**Key Considerations:**
- The title describes CTLA-4 deficiency, which is a primary immunodeficiency syndrome that CAN be associated with autoimmune hepatitis among other autoimmune manifestations
- However, the title focuses on ""pulmonary nodules"" as the presenting feature, not liver disease
- This appears to be a single case report (n=1), which falls under exclusion criterion #3
- Without an abstract, I cannot confirm whether AIH was present or discussed in this patient
- The abstract is completely unavailable, making it difficult to determine relevance

**Decision Logic:**
While the instruction suggests leaning toward INCLUDE when information is insufficient, this citation has two significant issues: (1) it appears to be a single patient case report, explicitly excluded by criterion #3, and (2) there is no indication in the title that autoimmune hepatitis is involved - the focus is on pulmonary manifestations.",anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929,2026-01-28T07:24:28.665047
301,Anti-programmed cell death-1 antibody as a new serological marker for type 1 autoimmune hepatitis.,,,10.1111/jgh.12340,include,"1. **Study type assessment**: The title suggests this is an original research article investigating anti-PD-1 antibodies as a serological marker. This appears to be original research rather than a review, editorial, or commentary.

2. **Relevant checkpoint receptor**: The study focuses on PD-1 (programmed cell death-1), which is explicitly listed as one of the checkpoint receptors of interest in the inclusion criteria.

3. **Disease condition**: The title specifically mentions ""type 1 autoimmune hepatitis,"" which directly matches the condition of interest (AIH).

4. **Study focus**: The study appears to examine anti-PD-1 antibodies in the context of AIH diagnosis/serology, which relates to the expression/functional role of this checkpoint receptor in AIH pathogenesis.

5. **Exclusion criteria check**:
   - Not identified as a conference abstract
   - Not a review article, editorial, or commentary based on the title
   - Not a case report with <3 patients (title suggests broader serological marker study)
   - Not exclusively about checkpoint inhibitor drug-induced liver injury (ICI-DILI)
   - Focuses on AIH, not PBC or PSC

6. **Abstract availability**: The abstract is not available, which limits full assessment. However, following the high sensitivity approach instructed, I should lean towards INCLUDE when information is insufficient.

7. **Language**: No indication that this is not in English.

The title strongly suggests this is a relevant original research study examining PD-1 in the context of autoimmune hepatitis, meeting the core inclusion criteria.",anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929,2026-01-28T07:24:38.147732
218,Antiphospholipid syndrome-induced ischemic stroke following pembrolizumab: Case report and systematic review.,,,10.1016/j.lungcan.2021.07.021,exclude,"1. **Study Type Assessment**: The title indicates this is a ""case report and systematic review"" about antiphospholipid syndrome-induced ischemic stroke following pembrolizumab treatment.

2. **Topic Relevance**:
   - The study focuses on antiphospholipid syndrome and ischemic stroke as complications of pembrolizumab (an immune checkpoint inhibitor)
   - Pembrolizumab is a PD-1 inhibitor, which is one of the checkpoint receptors listed in the inclusion criteria
   - However, the study appears to focus on neurological/hematological complications (stroke, antiphospholipid syndrome) rather than liver disease

3. **Disease Condition**:
   - The study does not mention autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) in the title
   - It focuses on antiphospholipid syndrome and stroke, not liver pathology
   - This does not meet the inclusion criterion requiring studies in AIH patients or animal models of AIH

4. **Exclusion Criteria Check**:
   - This appears to be a case report (likely <3 patients based on singular ""case report"") combined with a systematic review
   - The case report portion would be excluded under criterion #3 (case reports with fewer than 3 patients)
   - More importantly, this study focuses on checkpoint inhibitor drug complications (stroke/antiphospholipid syndrome), not on the role of checkpoint receptors in AIH pathogenesis

5. **Abstract Availability**: No abstract is available, but the title is sufficiently clear about the study's focus on stroke complications from pembrolizumab, not AIH.",anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929,2026-01-28T07:24:46.947236
201,Association of CTLA4 single nucleotide polymorphisms with viral but not autoimmune liver disease.,,,10.1097/MEG.0b013e3282efa240,include,"Let me evaluate this citation systematically against the inclusion and exclusion criteria:

**Analyzing the Title:**
- The study examines ""CTLA4 single nucleotide polymorphisms"" - CTLA-4 is one of the checkpoint receptors explicitly listed in the inclusion criteria (#2)
- The title states the study examines ""viral but not autoimmune liver disease""
- This phrasing suggests the study DID examine autoimmune liver disease (likely including AIH) but found no association with CTLA4 polymorphisms in that group
- The comparison appears to be between viral liver disease and autoimmune liver disease

**Checking Inclusion Criteria:**
1. Appears to be original research (studying genetic variants/SNPs)
2. ✓ Studies CTLA-4 genetic variants (explicitly mentioned)
3. Likely includes AIH patients (autoimmune liver disease mentioned)
4. ✓ Appears to compare disease groups
5. Unknown language, but no reason to suspect otherwise

**Checking Exclusion Criteria:**
1. Unknown if conference abstract - no full information provided
2. The title suggests original data (SNP association study)
3. Not a case report
4. Not about checkpoint inhibitor drug-induced liver injury
5. The study appears to focus on autoimmune liver disease (which would include AIH)

**Key Consideration:**
The title indicates ""viral but not autoimmune liver disease"" showed association with CTLA4 SNPs. This means autoimmune liver disease WAS studied, even though negative results were found. Negative findings are still relevant for a systematic review as they contribute to the overall evidence base.

**Missing Information:**
- No abstract available
- Cannot confirm if AIH specifically was included or if it was other autoimmune liver diseases (PBC, PSC)
- Cannot verify study design details

Given the high sensitivity approach recommended when information is insufficient, and that the study clearly examined CTLA-4 (a target checkpoint receptor) in autoimmune liver disease, this should be included for full-text review.",anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929,2026-01-28T07:24:59.466349
208,Association of a single nucleotide polymorphism upstream of ICOS with Japanese autoimmune hepatitis type 1.,,,10.1038/jhg.2016.155,exclude,"1. **Study Type Assessment**: The title suggests this is an original research article examining genetic associations (""Association of a single nucleotide polymorphism""). This appears to be original research rather than a review, editorial, or commentary.

2. **Disease Relevance**: The study explicitly focuses on ""autoimmune hepatitis type 1"" in Japanese patients, which directly meets inclusion criterion #3 (studies in patients with AIH).

3. **Checkpoint Receptor Relevance**: The study examines ICOS (Inducible T-cell COStimulator). However, ICOS is NOT listed among the specific checkpoint receptors in the inclusion criteria (BTLA, CTLA-4, PD-1, TIGIT, VISTA, LAG-3, CD200R). ICOS is a costimulatory molecule but is not one of the inhibitory checkpoint receptors specified in the protocol.

4. **Critical Issue**: The study focuses on ICOS, which is not among the specified checkpoint receptors of interest. The protocol is specifically about ""inhibitory checkpoint receptors"" and lists seven specific molecules. ICOS is actually a costimulatory (not inhibitory) molecule and is not on the specified list.

5. **Abstract Availability**: No abstract is available, which limits the assessment. However, the title is clear enough to determine that the focus is on ICOS, not the specified checkpoint receptors.

6. **Exclusion Criteria Check**: The study does not appear to meet any of the explicit exclusion criteria, but more importantly, it does not meet the core inclusion criteria regarding the specific checkpoint receptors of interest.",anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929,2026-01-28T07:25:09.229771

**Checking Inclusion Criteria:**

1. **Original research articles** - The title suggests this is an original research study examining genetic associations (polymorphisms), not a review or commentary.

2. **Studies examining expression, function, or genetic variants of specified checkpoint receptors** - Yes, this study examines CTLA-4 (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4) gene polymorphisms, which is explicitly listed as one of the checkpoint receptors of interest (CTLA-4).

3. **Studies in patients with autoimmune hepatitis or animal models** - Yes, the study is specifically about ""type 1 autoimmune hepatitis"" in Japanese patients.

4. **Studies comparing AIH to healthy controls or other liver disease controls** - While not explicitly stated in the title, genetic association studies typically involve comparison groups. This cannot be fully confirmed without the abstract.

5. **Published in English** - Cannot be confirmed from the title alone, but the title is in English, suggesting the article is likely in English.

**Checking Exclusion Criteria:**

1. **Conference abstracts without full text** - No indication this is a conference abstract; appears to be a full article.

2. **Review articles, editorials, commentaries, letters without original data** - The title suggests original research on genetic associations.

3. **Case reports with fewer than 3 patients** - Genetic association studies require larger sample sizes, so unlikely to be a small case report.

4. **Studies exclusively on checkpoint inhibitor drug-induced liver injury** - No, this is about autoimmune hepatitis, not drug-induced liver injury.

5. **Studies on PBC or PSC without AIH comparison** - No, this is specifically about AIH (type 1 autoimmune hepatitis).

**Available Information:**
- Title: ""Association of polymorphisms in non-classic MHC genes with susceptibility to autoimmune hepatitis""
- No abstract available
- No author, year, or journal information provided

**Evaluation against Inclusion Criteria:**

1. **Original research articles**: The title suggests this is likely an original research article examining genetic associations (polymorphisms), which typically involves original data analysis.

2. **Studies examining expression, function, or genetic variants of target checkpoint receptors**: The title mentions ""non-classic MHC genes"" - NOT the specific checkpoint receptors listed (BTLA, CTLA-4, PD-1, TIGIT, VISTA, LAG-3, or CD200R). Non-classic MHC genes typically refer to HLA-E, HLA-F, HLA-G, and similar molecules, which are different from the checkpoint receptors of interest.

3. **Studies in patients with AIH or animal models**: The title explicitly mentions ""autoimmune hepatitis,"" so this criterion appears to be met.

4. **Studies comparing AIH to controls**: The title mentions ""susceptibility to autoimmune hepatitis,"" which typically implies comparison groups, though this is not certain.

5. **Published in English**: Cannot determine from available information.

- Cannot definitively rule out any exclusion criteria due to lack of abstract and full information.

**Critical Issue:**
The main concern is that the study focuses on ""non-classic MHC genes"" rather than the specific checkpoint receptors listed in the inclusion criteria. These are distinct molecular entities with different functions, though both are involved in immune regulation.

**Decision Approach:**
Given the instruction to lean towards INCLUDE when information is insufficient, and considering that without an abstract I cannot definitively confirm the study does NOT involve any of the target checkpoint receptors, I must weigh the clear mismatch in the gene families mentioned.",anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929,2026-01-28T07:25:30.961605
160,Association of the HLA locus and TNF with type I autoimmune hepatitis susceptibility in New Zealand Caucasians.,,,10.1186/2193-1801-2-355,exclude,"Let me evaluate this citation systematically against the inclusion and exclusion criteria:

**Analyzing the Title:**
- The study focuses on ""type I autoimmune hepatitis"" - this directly matches the condition of interest (AIH)
- It examines ""HLA locus and TNF"" associations with AIH susceptibility
- The population is ""New Zealand Caucasians""
- This appears to be a genetic association study

**Checking Inclusion Criteria:**
1. Original research articles - The title suggests this is an original research study examining genetic associations
2. Studies examining checkpoint receptors (BTLA, CTLA-4, PD-1, TIGIT, VISTA, LAG-3, CD200R) - The study focuses on HLA and TNF, which are NOT among the checkpoint receptors listed in the protocol
3. Studies in patients with AIH - YES, this is clearly about type I autoimmune hepatitis
4. Studies comparing AIH to controls - Likely, given it's a susceptibility/association study
5. Published in English - Cannot determine from title alone, but likely given the journal context

**Checking Exclusion Criteria:**
1. Conference abstract - Cannot determine from information provided
2. Review article/editorial - Appears to be original research based on title
3. Case report <3 patients - Unlikely given it's an association study
4. Studies exclusively on ICI-DILI - NO, this is about type I AIH
5. Studies on PBC/PSC without AIH - NO, this is specifically about AIH

**Critical Issue:**
The main problem is that this study examines HLA and TNF, which are NOT among the inhibitory checkpoint receptors specified in the protocol (BTLA, CTLA-4, PD-1, TIGIT, VISTA, LAG-3, CD200R). The study does not appear to examine any of the checkpoint receptors of interest.

**Abstract Availability:**
The abstract is not available, which creates uncertainty. However, the title is quite specific about examining HLA and TNF, making it unlikely that checkpoint receptors are the focus.",anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929,2026-01-28T07:25:42.886588
262,Astaxanthin Alleviates Autoimmune Hepatitis by Modulating CD8(+) T Cells: Insights From Mass Cytometry and Single-Cell RNA Sequencing Analyses.,,,10.1002/advs.202403148,include,"Let me evaluate this citation systematically against the inclusion and exclusion criteria:

**Assessing Inclusion Criteria:**

1. **Original research article**: The title suggests this is an original research study using mass cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing, which are advanced research methodologies. This appears to be original research.

2. **Studies examining checkpoint receptors**: The study focuses on CD8+ T cells in autoimmune hepatitis. While the title doesn't explicitly mention the specific checkpoint receptors listed (BTLA, CTLA-4, PD-1, TIGIT, VISTA, LAG-3, CD200R), the use of mass cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing to characterize CD8+ T cells could potentially include analysis of these checkpoint receptors, as these are comprehensive profiling techniques that often examine immune checkpoint molecules on T cells.

3. **Studies in AIH patients or animal models**: The study explicitly mentions autoimmune hepatitis, meeting this criterion.

4. **Comparison to controls**: Not clear from the title alone, but the methodology suggests comparative analysis.

5. **Published in English**: The title is in English, suggesting the article is in English.

**Assessing Exclusion Criteria:**

1. **Conference abstract**: Cannot determine from the information provided
2. **Review article/editorial**: The methodology mentioned suggests original research, not a review
3. **Case report <3 patients**: Unlikely given the advanced methodologies used
4. **Exclusively on ICI-DILI**: The study is about astaxanthin treatment, not checkpoint inhibitor drugs
5. **PBC/PSC without AIH**: The study is specifically about AIH

**Key Consideration:**
The abstract is not available, making it difficult to confirm whether the specific checkpoint receptors of interest are examined. However, given that:
- Mass cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing are comprehensive immune profiling techniques
- CD8+ T cells are a primary focus, and checkpoint receptors are commonly expressed on these cells
- The instruction states to ""lean towards INCLUDE to avoid missing potentially relevant studies (high sensitivity approach)"" when abstract information is insufficient",anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929,2026-01-28T07:25:54.196078

2. **Topic Relevance**:
   - The study describes ""autoimmune colitis"" and ""CMV-induced hepatitis"" following Ipilimumab treatment
   - Ipilimumab is a CTLA-4 checkpoint inhibitor used in cancer immunotherapy
   - This appears to be about immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced adverse events, NOT about autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) as a primary disease

3. **Exclusion Criteria Application**:
   - **Exclusion criterion #4** specifically states: ""Studies exclusively on checkpoint inhibitor drug-induced liver injury (ICI-DILI)""
   - This study describes hepatitis induced by checkpoint inhibitor treatment (ipilimumab), which falls under ICI-DILI
   - Additionally, the hepatitis described is CMV-induced (viral), not autoimmune hepatitis

4. **Inclusion Criteria Assessment**:
   - Does NOT study patients with autoimmune hepatitis (criterion #3)
   - Does NOT study AIH pathogenesis or the role of checkpoint receptors IN AIH
   - Instead, studies adverse effects FROM checkpoint inhibitor therapy

5. **Case Report Consideration**:
   - The title format suggests this may be a case report with likely fewer than 3 patients (exclusion criterion #3)

6. **Abstract Availability**: While the abstract is not available, the title is sufficiently clear to determine this is about drug-induced adverse events, not AIH as a disease entity.",anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929,2026-01-28T07:26:03.248938

1. Original research articles - Cannot determine from title alone; could be original research
2. Studies examining checkpoint receptors - No indication in the title that this study examines BTLA, CTLA-4, PD-1, TIGIT, VISTA, LAG-3, or CD200R
3. Studies in AIH patients/models - Yes, title mentions ""Autoimmune Hepatitis""
4. Comparison to controls - Cannot determine from title
5. Published in English - Cannot confirm, but title is in English

**Assessment against Exclusion Criteria:**
1. Conference abstract - Cannot determine
2. Review/editorial/commentary - Cannot determine from title alone
3. Case report <3 patients - Cannot determine
4. Studies exclusively on checkpoint inhibitor drug-induced liver injury - The title mentions ""Drug-Induced Liver Injury"" which raises concern, but it's paired with ""Autoimmune Hepatitis"" so it may not be exclusively about ICI-DILI
5. PBC/PSC without AIH - Not applicable; AIH is mentioned

**Key Concerns:**
- The title suggests this may be about drug-induced liver injury alongside AIH, but does not indicate any focus on checkpoint receptors or their ligands, which is the core focus of this systematic review
- No abstract is available to clarify whether checkpoint receptors are studied
- The pairing of AIH with drug-induced liver injury in the title suggests this may be a general epidemiological or clinical study rather than one focused on immunological mechanisms

**Decision Approach:**
While the instruction suggests leaning toward INCLUDE when information is insufficient, the title provides no indication whatsoever that this study examines any of the specific checkpoint receptors that are the focus of this review. The study appears to be about AIH and DILI in general, likely epidemiological or clinical in nature.",anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929,2026-01-28T07:26:15.431424
265,Autoimmune Hepatitis: Pathophysiology.,,,10.1016/j.cld.2023.06.003,exclude,"1. **Publication Type Assessment**: The title ""Autoimmune Hepatitis: Pathophysiology"" suggests this could be a review article or book chapter rather than an original research article. The broad, general nature of the title is typical of review articles or textbook chapters that provide overviews of disease mechanisms.

2. **Lack of Information**: There is no abstract available, no author information, no journal information, and no year of publication. This makes it extremely difficult to assess whether this meets inclusion criteria.

3. **Title Analysis**: The title indicates the article is about autoimmune hepatitis pathophysiology, which is relevant to the review topic. However, it does not specifically mention any of the checkpoint receptors of interest (BTLA, CTLA-4, PD-1, TIGIT, VISTA, LAG-3, CD200R).

4. **Exclusion Criteria Check**:
   - The title format strongly suggests this may be a review article or book chapter (Exclusion criterion #2)
   - Without an abstract or full text, we cannot confirm if this contains original data
   - The broad title ""Pathophysiology"" is characteristic of review/overview articles rather than original research

5. **Inclusion Criteria Check**:
   - Cannot confirm if this is an original research article
   - Cannot confirm if it examines the specific checkpoint receptors of interest
   - The topic (AIH) is relevant, but relevance to the specific research question is unclear

6. **High Sensitivity Approach Consideration**: While the instruction suggests leaning toward INCLUDE when information is insufficient, the title itself provides a strong signal that this is likely a review article rather than original research, which is explicitly excluded.",anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929,2026-01-28T07:26:25.563800
197,Avelumab for Advanced Merkel Cell Carcinoma: Global Real-World Data on Patient Response and Survival.,,,10.2147/POR.S398151,exclude,"1. **Study Type Assessment**: The title suggests this is a study on ""real-world data"" examining patient response and survival, which appears to be an original research article reporting clinical outcomes.

2. **Subject Matter**: The study is about Avelumab (an anti-PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitor drug) used to treat Merkel Cell Carcinoma (a type of skin cancer), not autoimmune hepatitis (AIH).

3. **Relevance to Checkpoint Receptors**: While Avelumab is a checkpoint inhibitor that targets PD-L1 (a ligand for PD-1, which is one of the checkpoint receptors in the inclusion criteria), the study is focused on cancer treatment, not autoimmune hepatitis.

4. **Disease Focus**: The study examines Merkel Cell Carcinoma, which is completely unrelated to autoimmune hepatitis. There is no indication from the title that this study involves:
   - Patients with autoimmune hepatitis
   - Animal models of AIH
   - Comparison with AIH patients
   - Any connection to liver disease

5. **Exclusion Criteria Check**: While this involves checkpoint inhibitor drugs, it is not about checkpoint inhibitor drug-induced liver injury (ICI-DILI) - it's about cancer treatment efficacy.

6. **Inclusion Criteria Check**: The study fails to meet criterion #3 (studies in patients with AIH or animal models of AIH), which is fundamental to the review's scope.",anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929,2026-01-28T07:26:34.199058

1. **Study type**: The title suggests this is an original research article involving murine (mouse) studies, which would meet inclusion criterion #1 (animal studies).

2. **Checkpoint receptor examined**: The study examines CTLA-4, which is specifically listed as one of the checkpoint receptors of interest (inclusion criterion #2).

3. **Disease focus**: The title indicates this study is about:
   - Bone marrow chimeras
   - Antileukemic effect (cancer/leukemia treatment)
   - Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)

   This appears to be a study in the context of bone marrow transplantation and leukemia, NOT autoimmune hepatitis or any liver disease.

4. **Relevance to AIH**: There is no mention of:
   - Autoimmune hepatitis
   - Liver disease
   - Hepatitis of any kind
   - Animal models of AIH

   The study does not meet inclusion criterion #3 (studies in patients with AIH or animal models of AIH).

5. **Abstract availability**: No abstract is available, but the title is sufficiently clear about the study's focus on leukemia and bone marrow transplantation rather than autoimmune hepatitis.

While the study does examine CTLA-4 (a checkpoint receptor of interest), it is clearly focused on cancer immunotherapy and transplantation biology, not autoimmune hepatitis. The inclusion criteria specifically require studies to be conducted in AIH patients or animal models of AIH (criterion #3), which this study does not meet.",anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929,2026-01-28T07:26:42.601426

**Assessing Inclusion Criteria:**
1. Original research articles - The title suggests this is an original research study examining polymorphisms, likely original data
2. Studies examining CTLA-4 - YES, the title explicitly mentions ""CTLA-4/CD28 region polymorphisms""
3. Studies in AIH patients - YES, the title specifies ""children from families with autoimmune hepatitis""
4. Comparison groups - Not clear from title alone, but family studies typically involve comparisons
5. Language - Cannot determine from available information, but no indication it's not in English

**Assessing Exclusion Criteria:**
1. Conference abstract - Cannot determine from the information provided
2. Review article/editorial/commentary - The title suggests original research on polymorphisms, not a review
3. Case report <3 patients - Unlikely, as it mentions ""children from families"" (plural), suggesting multiple subjects
4. Exclusively ICI-DILI - NO, this is about genetic polymorphisms in AIH patients, not drug-induced injury
5. PBC/PSC without AIH - NO, specifically mentions autoimmune hepatitis

**Key Considerations:**
- The abstract is not available, making full assessment difficult
- The title clearly indicates relevance to the review: it examines CTLA-4 (one of the target checkpoint receptors) in the context of autoimmune hepatitis
- This appears to be a genetic association study, which falls under the inclusion criteria (genetic variants of checkpoint receptors)

**Title Analysis:**
The title indicates this is a study about:
- CTLA-4 blockade (one of the checkpoint receptors of interest)
- Patients with metastatic melanoma (cancer patients)
- Cancer regression AND autoimmunity as outcomes

**Checking Inclusion Criteria:**
1. Original research articles - The title suggests this is original research (appears to report patient outcomes)
2. Studies examining CTLA-4 - YES, CTLA-4 blockade is the intervention
3. Studies in AIH patients or animal models - UNCLEAR from title alone; the study is in melanoma patients, but mentions ""autoimmunity induced""
4. Comparison to controls - Cannot determine from title
5. Published in English - Appears to be English

**Checking Exclusion Criteria:**
1. Conference abstract - Cannot determine from available information
2. Review/editorial/commentary - Title suggests original research
3. Case report <3 patients - Title says ""patients"" (plural), likely more than 3
4. Studies exclusively on checkpoint inhibitor drug-induced liver injury (ICI-DILI) - This is a critical point. The study is about CTLA-4 blockade in melanoma patients who developed autoimmunity. This could potentially include autoimmune hepatitis as a side effect of checkpoint inhibitor therapy, which would fall under exclusion criterion #4 (ICI-DILI)
5. PBC/PSC without AIH - Not applicable

**Key Consideration:**
The study appears to be about checkpoint inhibitor-induced autoimmunity in cancer patients, which would likely include drug-induced liver injury/hepatitis. This falls under exclusion criterion #4. However, without the abstract, I cannot confirm:
- Whether liver/hepatic autoimmunity was actually studied
- Whether this is specifically about drug-induced effects vs. mechanistic insights into autoimmunity

Given the high sensitivity approach recommended when information is insufficient, and that this study involves a relevant checkpoint receptor (CTLA-4), there is a small possibility it could provide relevant mechanistic insights.",anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929,2026-01-28T07:27:06.335651

2. **Topic Relevance**:
   - The study is about melanoma (a type of cancer) and its response to COVID-19 infection
   - There is no mention of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) in the title
   - There is no mention of any checkpoint receptors (BTLA, CTLA-4, PD-1, TIGIT, VISTA, LAG-3, CD200R) in the title
   - The focus is on tumor regression in melanoma, not liver disease

3. **Exclusion Criteria Application**:
   - This appears to be a case report. According to exclusion criterion #3, case reports with fewer than 3 patients are excluded. The title suggests this is a single case (""An unexpected case"")
   - The study topic (melanoma and COVID-19) does not relate to autoimmune hepatitis, which violates the core inclusion criteria

4. **Inclusion Criteria Application**:
   - Does not appear to examine AIH patients or animal models of AIH (criterion #3)
   - Does not appear to study the specified checkpoint receptors in the context of AIH (criterion #2)

209,Cemiplimab for the Treatment of Advanced Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma: Appropriate Patient Selection and Perspectives.,,,10.2147/CCID.S381471,exclude,"1. **Study Topic Assessment**: The title indicates this is about ""Cemiplimab for the Treatment of Advanced Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma"" with a focus on patient selection and perspectives. Cemiplimab is a PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor used in cancer treatment.

2. **Disease Focus**: The study is clearly focused on cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (a type of skin cancer), not autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). There is no mention of AIH, liver disease, or autoimmune conditions in the title.

3. **Checkpoint Inhibitor Context**: While the study involves a checkpoint inhibitor (cemiplimab targets PD-1), it appears to be about:
   - Cancer treatment (not autoimmune disease)
   - Patient selection for therapy (not pathogenesis or expression patterns)
   - Clinical perspectives on drug use

4. **Exclusion Criteria Application**:
   - The study appears to focus on checkpoint inhibitor use in cancer, not AIH
   - Even if it discussed adverse events, the exclusion criteria specifically mention ""Studies exclusively on checkpoint inhibitor drug-induced liver injury (ICI-DILI)"" should be excluded
   - This study doesn't appear to be about AIH pathogenesis, expression patterns, or genetic associations of checkpoint receptors in AIH

5. **Inclusion Criteria Assessment**:
   - Does not appear to involve AIH patients or animal models of AIH
   - Does not appear to examine checkpoint receptors in the context of autoimmune hepatitis pathogenesis

308,Checkpoint Blockade Toxicity and Immune Homeostasis in the Gastrointestinal Tract.,,,10.3389/fimmu.2017.01547,exclude,"1. **Article Type Assessment**: The title suggests this could be a review article about checkpoint blockade toxicity and immune homeostasis in the GI tract. Without an abstract or additional information, I cannot definitively determine if this contains original research data.

2. **Topic Relevance**:
   - The article discusses ""checkpoint blockade toxicity"" which relates to checkpoint inhibitors
   - However, the inclusion criteria specifically focus on the expression, function, or genetic variants of specific checkpoint receptors (BTLA, CTLA-4, PD-1, TIGIT, VISTA, LAG-3, CD200R) in the context of autoimmune hepatitis
   - The exclusion criteria (#4) specifically exclude ""studies exclusively on checkpoint inhibitor drug-induced liver injury (ICI-DILI)""

3. **Disease Focus**:
   - The title mentions ""gastrointestinal tract"" broadly, not specifically autoimmune hepatitis
   - There is no indication from the title that this study focuses on AIH patients or animal models of AIH
   - The focus appears to be on toxicity from checkpoint blockade therapy rather than the role of checkpoint receptors in autoimmune hepatitis pathogenesis

4. **Checkpoint Inhibitor Drug-Induced Injury**: The title's focus on ""checkpoint blockade toxicity"" strongly suggests this is about adverse effects from checkpoint inhibitor drugs (ICI-DILI), which is explicitly excluded by exclusion criterion #4.

5. **Missing Information**: While the abstract is missing, the title alone provides sufficient information to suggest this article does not meet the inclusion criteria, as it appears to focus on drug-induced toxicity rather than the pathogenesis of autoimmune hepatitis.",anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929,2026-01-28T07:27:33.000254

   - A book chapter
   - An editorial or commentary
   - Original research
   - Studies about checkpoint inhibitor drugs (ICI-DILI)
   - Studies about checkpoint inhibitor molecules/receptors

   - Cannot verify if it involves AIH patients or models (Inclusion criteria #3)
   - Cannot verify study design (Inclusion criteria #4)
   - Cannot verify language (Inclusion criteria #5)

5. **Applying the high sensitivity approach**: The instructions state that when abstract is missing or insufficient, I should lean towards INCLUDE to avoid missing potentially relevant studies. However, this citation provides virtually no information beyond a very generic title that could apply to thousands of publications.

6. **Risk assessment**: The extremely generic title ""Checkpoint Inhibitors"" without any other identifying information makes it highly unlikely this is a relevant study about checkpoint receptors in AIH pathogenesis.

**Evaluation Against Exclusion Criteria:**

1. **Conference abstract without full text**: Cannot determine from the information provided

2. **Review articles, editorials, commentaries, letters without original data**: The title suggests this could be a review article given the broad scope (""pathogenesis and management""), but cannot confirm without more information

3. **Case reports with fewer than 3 patients**: Unlikely based on title

4. **Studies exclusively on checkpoint inhibitor drug-induced liver injury (ICI-DILI)**: This is a critical concern. The title specifically mentions ""checkpoint inhibitor hepatotoxicity,"" which strongly suggests this is about drug-induced liver injury from checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy (ICI-DILI), NOT about the role of checkpoint receptors in autoimmune hepatitis pathogenesis. This appears to be about the adverse effects of checkpoint inhibitor drugs used in cancer treatment.

5. **Studies on PBC or PSC without AIH comparison**: Not applicable

**Evaluation Against Inclusion Criteria:**
- The study appears to focus on hepatotoxicity caused by checkpoint inhibitor drugs, which is explicitly excluded (exclusion criterion #4)
- This is fundamentally different from studying whether endogenous checkpoint receptors play a role in AIH pathogenesis

**Available Information:**
- Title: ""Chronically inflamed livers up-regulate expression of inhibitory B7 family members""
- No abstract available
- No author, year, or journal information provided

**Analysis:**

1. **Relevance to checkpoint receptors:** The title mentions ""inhibitory B7 family members."" The B7 family includes several checkpoint-related molecules, including:
   - B7-1 (CD80) and B7-2 (CD86) - ligands for CTLA-4
   - PD-L1 (B7-H1) and PD-L2 (B7-DC) - ligands for PD-1
   - B7-H3, B7-H4, and other members

   This is directly relevant to the review's focus on checkpoint receptors and their ligands.

2. **Relevance to liver inflammation:** The title specifically mentions ""chronically inflamed livers,"" which could include autoimmune hepatitis as a form of chronic liver inflammation.

3. **Type of study:** The title suggests this is likely an original research article examining expression patterns (uses ""up-regulate expression""), which meets inclusion criterion #1.

   - No abstract is available to confirm the specific disease studied
   - Cannot confirm if AIH is specifically included
   - Cannot verify if it meets all inclusion criteria
   - Cannot rule out exclusion criteria definitively

   - It does not appear to be examining the pathogenesis of AIH through checkpoint receptors (criterion #2 in context of AIH)
   - Instead, it focuses on adverse drug reactions (liver injury) caused by checkpoint inhibitor therapy

5. **Key Distinction**: This study is about iatrogenic liver injury caused by checkpoint inhibitor drugs (used in cancer treatment), NOT about the role of checkpoint receptors in the pathogenesis of autoimmune hepatitis. These are fundamentally different research questions.

6. **Abstract Availability**: While the abstract is not available, the title is sufficiently clear to make a determination based on the explicit exclusion criterion for ICI-DILI studies.",anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929,2026-01-28T07:28:23.489591

**Title Analysis:**
The title indicates this study examines ""Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor-induced Liver Injury"" and compares it with both ""Drug-induced Liver Injury"" and ""Autoimmune Hepatitis.""

**Checking Exclusion Criteria:**

1. Conference abstract without full text - Cannot determine from the information provided
2. Review article/editorial/commentary - The title suggests this is an original research article with clinical and pathological features being compared
3. Case report with <3 patients - Unlikely given the comparative nature described in the title
4. **Studies EXCLUSIVELY on checkpoint inhibitor drug-induced liver injury (ICI-DILI)** - This is the critical criterion. The title indicates the study is about ""Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor-induced Liver Injury"" which is ICI-DILI. However, it is NOT exclusively about ICI-DILI because it includes a comparison with autoimmune hepatitis.
5. Studies on PBC/PSC without AIH comparison - Not applicable

**Checking Inclusion Criteria:**

The study appears to:
- Include AIH patients (as a comparison group)
- Likely be an original research article (based on title structure)
- Potentially provide data on checkpoint-related pathology in AIH context

**Key Consideration:**
While the primary focus appears to be on ICI-induced liver injury, the study explicitly compares this condition with autoimmune hepatitis. This comparison could provide valuable information about checkpoint receptor involvement in AIH pathogenesis, expression patterns, or pathological features that distinguish or overlap between ICI-DILI and AIH.

The exclusion criterion #4 specifies ""exclusively"" on ICI-DILI. Since this study includes AIH as a comparison group, it is not exclusively about ICI-DILI.

**Abstract Limitation:**
No abstract is available, which limits my ability to determine the exact nature of the data presented about AIH patients.",anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929,2026-01-28T07:28:35.167309
183,Clinicopathological analysis of hepatic immune-related adverse events in comparison with autoimmune hepatitis and graft-versus host disease.,,,10.1038/s41598-021-88824-1,exclude,"Let me evaluate this citation systematically against the inclusion and exclusion criteria:

**Title Analysis:**
The title mentions ""hepatic immune-related adverse events"" which typically refers to checkpoint inhibitor drug-induced liver injury (ICI-DILI). The study appears to be a comparison between:
1. Hepatic immune-related adverse events (irAEs)
2. Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH)
3. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)

**Checking Exclusion Criteria:**
- Exclusion criterion #4 specifically states: ""Studies exclusively on checkpoint inhibitor drug-induced liver injury (ICI-DILI)""
- The term ""immune-related adverse events"" in the hepatic context is the standard terminology for ICI-DILI
- This appears to be a comparative study that includes AIH as a comparator group, but the primary focus seems to be on characterizing hepatic irAEs

**Checking Inclusion Criteria:**
- The study does involve AIH patients (as a comparison group)
- Without an abstract, I cannot determine if the study examines the specific checkpoint receptors of interest (BTLA, CTLA-4, PD-1, TIGIT, VISTA, LAG-3, CD200R)
- The study appears to be a clinicopathological analysis, which could potentially include original research data

**Key Consideration:**
The critical question is whether this study is ""exclusively"" on ICI-DILI. The title suggests it's a comparative study that includes AIH, which means it's not exclusively about ICI-DILI. However, the primary focus appears to be characterizing hepatic irAEs (ICI-DILI) using AIH as a comparator, rather than studying AIH pathogenesis itself.

Without the abstract, I cannot determine if this study examines the expression or function of the checkpoint receptors of interest in the AIH patients, which would be necessary for inclusion.

**Decision Rationale:**
Given the instruction to ""lean towards INCLUDE to avoid missing potentially relevant studies"" when information is insufficient, and considering that:
1. The study does involve AIH patients
2. It might contain data on checkpoint receptor expression/function (unknown without abstract)
3. It's not exclusively about ICI-DILI (includes AIH comparison)

However, the primary focus on hepatic irAEs suggests this is likely outside the scope of the review's objective to understand checkpoint receptors in AIH pathogenesis.",anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929,2026-01-28T07:28:48.827769

2. **Checkpoint Receptor Relevance**: The study explicitly mentions CTLA-4 (CTL-associated antigen-4), which is one of the specific checkpoint receptors listed in the inclusion criteria (#2).

3. **Disease Focus Assessment**: The title clearly indicates this is a tumor/cancer immunology study (""tumor site-located,"" ""tumor-destructive immune responses""). There is no mention of:
   - Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH)
   - Liver disease
   - Autoimmune liver conditions
   - Animal models of AIH

4. **Scope Mismatch**: This appears to be an oncology/cancer immunotherapy study focused on using CTLA-4 blockade and Treg depletion to destroy tumors, not a study of autoimmune hepatitis pathogenesis.

5. **Inclusion Criteria #3 Not Met**: The study does not appear to involve patients with autoimmune hepatitis or animal models of AIH, which is a core requirement.

6. **Abstract Limitation**: While the abstract is not available, the title is sufficiently clear about the study's focus on tumor immunology rather than autoimmune hepatitis.

Despite the general principle of being inclusive when information is limited, the title provides enough information to determine that this study is focused on cancer/tumor immunology rather than autoimmune hepatitis, which is the specific disease focus required by the review protocol.",anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929,2026-01-28T07:28:58.110148

1. **Study Type**: The title indicates this is a ""pooled analysis of 3 Phase 1 Trials,"" which suggests original research data, meeting inclusion criterion #1.

2. **Topic Relevance**: The study is about ""Combined Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy and Immune Checkpoint Inhibition for Liver Metastases."" This is clearly about:
   - Cancer treatment (liver metastases)
   - Checkpoint inhibitor drugs as therapeutic intervention
   - Not about autoimmune hepatitis (AIH)

3. **Disease Focus**: The study focuses on liver metastases (cancer), not autoimmune hepatitis. This does not meet inclusion criterion #3, which requires studies in patients with AIH or animal models of AIH.

4. **Checkpoint Receptors**: While the study involves immune checkpoint inhibition, it appears to be about checkpoint inhibitor drugs used for cancer treatment, not about the expression, function, or genetic variants of checkpoint receptors in the context of autoimmune disease pathogenesis (inclusion criterion #2).

5. **Exclusion Criteria**: While this study involves checkpoint inhibitors and liver involvement, it is about cancer treatment with liver metastases, not about autoimmune hepatitis or checkpoint inhibitor-induced liver injury (ICI-DILI).

The fundamental issue is that this study is about cancer immunotherapy for liver metastases, not about autoimmune hepatitis pathogenesis or the role of checkpoint receptors in AIH.",anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929,2026-01-28T07:29:05.964683

**Assessment of Inclusion Criteria:**
1. Original research articles - The title suggests this could be an original research article (""Comprehensive analysis""), but without an abstract, I cannot confirm this definitively.
2. Studies examining checkpoint receptors - The title mentions ""immune signatures"" which could potentially include checkpoint receptors (BTLA, CTLA-4, PD-1, TIGIT, VISTA, LAG-3, or CD200R), but this is not explicitly stated.
3. Studies in AIH patients/models - The title explicitly mentions ""autoimmune hepatitis,"" meeting this criterion.
4. Comparison groups - The title mentions both ""primary biliary cholangitis and autoimmune hepatitis,"" suggesting a comparative study.
5. Language - Unknown, but no indication it's not in English.

**Assessment of Exclusion Criteria:**
1. Conference abstract - Cannot determine from the information provided.
2. Review article/editorial - The word ""analysis"" could suggest original research, but could also be a review. Cannot definitively determine.
3. Case report <3 patients - Unlikely given the title suggests ""comprehensive analysis.""
4. Exclusively ICI-DILI - No indication of this; appears to be about primary disease.
5. PBC/PSC without AIH comparison - The title explicitly mentions BOTH PBC AND AIH, so this is a comparative study that includes AIH.

**Key Considerations:**
- The abstract is not available, making it difficult to determine the exact nature of the study
- The title explicitly mentions AIH, which is the disease of interest
- The title mentions ""immune signatures"" which could potentially include checkpoint receptors, though not explicitly stated
- Following the instruction to ""lean towards INCLUDE to avoid missing potentially relevant studies (high sensitivity approach)"" when information is insufficient",anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929,2026-01-28T07:29:15.684867

Corrigenda typically fall under the exclusion criteria as they are similar to editorials, commentaries, or letters - they are not original research articles themselves.

2. **Content Relevance**: The title suggests the original article was about PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint therapy in patients with autoimmune and cholestatic liver disease, which would include autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). This topic is relevant to the review's focus on checkpoint receptors in AIH.

3. **Checkpoint Receptor Coverage**: PD-1 and PD-L1 are specifically listed in the inclusion criteria as checkpoint receptors of interest.

4. **Exclusion Criteria Consideration**:
   - This appears to be a corrigendum, not an original research article
   - Exclusion criterion #2 states: ""Review articles, editorials, commentaries, letters without original data"" should be excluded
   - A corrigendum is a correction notice and does not contain original data itself

5. **Abstract Availability**: No abstract is available, which limits assessment. However, the title clearly identifies this as a corrigendum.

6. **Clinical Context**: The mention of ""checkpoint inhibitor therapy"" and ""safety profile"" suggests this may relate to checkpoint inhibitor drug-induced liver injury (ICI-DILI), which is explicitly excluded (criterion #4). However, without the full text or abstract, this cannot be confirmed definitively.",anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929,2026-01-28T07:29:25.267177
242,Cutting edge: chronic inflammatory liver disease in mice expressing a CD28-specific ligand.,,,10.4049/jimmunol.1202621,include,"1. **Study Type Assessment**: The title suggests this is an original research article (""Cutting edge"" is a format used by journals like The Journal of Immunology for brief reports of original research). This meets inclusion criterion #1.

2. **Relevant Checkpoint Molecules**: The title mentions ""CD28-specific ligand."" CD28 is a costimulatory receptor, and its ligands include CD80 (B7-1) and CD86 (B7-2). Importantly, CTLA-4 (one of the checkpoint receptors in our inclusion criteria) shares these same ligands with CD28. Studies examining CD28 ligands are relevant because they directly relate to CTLA-4 function and the balance between costimulation and coinhibition. This potentially meets inclusion criterion #2.

3. **Disease Model**: The title explicitly mentions ""chronic inflammatory liver disease in mice,"" indicating this is an animal model study. This could be relevant to AIH pathogenesis (inclusion criterion #3), though the abstract is not available to confirm if this is specifically an AIH model.

4. **Language**: Assuming this is from a major scientific journal (given the ""Cutting edge"" designation), it is likely published in English, meeting inclusion criterion #5.

5. **Limitations**:
   - No abstract is available to confirm the specific details
   - Cannot confirm if this is specifically an AIH model or another form of chronic inflammatory liver disease
   - Cannot verify if CTLA-4 or other checkpoint receptors are actually studied in the paper

6. **High Sensitivity Approach**: Given the instruction to lean towards INCLUDE when information is insufficient, and considering that:
   - This involves CD28 ligands (relevant to CTLA-4 pathway)
   - It's a chronic inflammatory liver disease model
   - It could provide mechanistic insights into checkpoint pathways in liver inflammation",anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929,2026-01-28T07:29:36.258536

2. **Studies examining expression, function, or genetic variants of specified checkpoint receptors**: Yes - BTLA (B and T Lymphocyte Attenuator) is explicitly mentioned in the title and is one of the checkpoint receptors listed in the protocol.

3. **Studies in AIH patients or animal models**: Yes - the title indicates ""development of autoimmune hepatitis-like disease"" in mice, which constitutes an animal model of AIH.

4. **Studies comparing AIH to healthy controls or other controls**: The study uses BTLA knockout mice, which implies comparison to wild-type controls (standard experimental design).

5. **Published in English**: The title is in English, suggesting the article is in English.

**Analyzing Exclusion Criteria:**

1. **Conference abstracts without full text**: Cannot determine from the information provided, but the title suggests a complete study.

2. **Review articles, editorials, commentaries, letters**: The title structure suggests original research, not a review or commentary.

3. **Case reports with fewer than 3 patients**: Not applicable - this is an animal study.

4. **Studies exclusively on checkpoint inhibitor drug-induced liver injury**: No - this is about genetic knockout mice developing AIH-like disease, not drug-induced injury.

5. **Studies on PBC or PSC without AIH comparison**: Not applicable - focuses on AIH-like disease.

**Assessment:**
This citation appears highly relevant to the review objectives. It directly addresses BTLA's role in AIH pathogenesis using an animal model. The absence of an abstract is noted in the protocol instructions, which recommend leaning towards INCLUDE to maintain high sensitivity.",anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929,2026-01-28T07:31:11.198395

**Analyzing the title:**
- The study is about ""hepatitis triggered by SARS-CoV-2 vaccination""
- It involves a patient with cancer during immunotherapy
- It is explicitly labeled as ""a case report""

**Checking against EXCLUSION criteria:**

1. **Conference abstracts without full text**: Cannot determine from the information provided, but it appears to be a full article (case report)

2. **Review articles, editorials, commentaries, letters without original data**: This is a case report, which contains original data

3. **Case reports with fewer than 3 patients**: This is described as ""a case report"" (singular), which typically means it involves 1-2 patients, thus fewer than 3 patients. This meets an **exclusion criterion**.

4. **Studies exclusively on checkpoint inhibitor drug-induced liver injury (ICI-DILI)**: The title suggests this is about vaccine-induced hepatitis in a patient receiving immunotherapy. This appears to be about drug-induced liver injury from checkpoint inhibitors, which would meet this **exclusion criterion**.

5. **Studies on PBC or PSC without AIH comparison**: Not applicable here

**Checking against INCLUSION criteria:**
- The study does not appear to be about autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) specifically
- It's about vaccine-triggered hepatitis in the context of cancer immunotherapy
- It's a single case report (fewer than 3 patients)

**Conclusion:**
This citation meets at least two exclusion criteria: (1) it is a case report with fewer than 3 patients, and (2) it appears to be about checkpoint inhibitor-related liver injury rather than autoimmune hepatitis as a primary disease entity.",anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929,2026-01-28T07:31:21.258568

**Assessing Inclusion Criteria:**

1. **Original research articles** - The title suggests this is likely an original research study examining ""diagnostic value,"" which typically involves original data collection and analysis. ✓

2. **Studies examining expression, function, or genetic variants of specified checkpoint receptors** - The study explicitly mentions ""soluble programmed cell death protein-1"" (sPD-1), which is directly related to PD-1, one of the checkpoint receptors specified in the protocol. ✓

3. **Studies in patients with autoimmune hepatitis or animal models** - The title clearly states ""type-1 autoimmune hepatitis"" in the patient population. ✓

4. **Studies comparing AIH to healthy controls or other liver disease controls** - While not explicitly stated in the title, diagnostic value studies typically require comparison groups to establish diagnostic utility. Likely ✓

5. **Published in English** - Cannot be determined from the information provided, but the title is in English. Likely ✓

**Assessing Exclusion Criteria:**

1. **Conference abstracts without full text** - Cannot determine publication type from the information provided.

2. **Review articles, editorials, commentaries, letters without original data** - The title suggests original research on diagnostic value. Unlikely to be excluded.

3. **Case reports with fewer than 3 patients** - The title mentions ""Egyptian children"" (plural), suggesting more than 3 patients. Unlikely to be excluded.

4. **Studies exclusively on checkpoint inhibitor drug-induced liver injury** - This is about autoimmune hepatitis, not drug-induced injury. Not excluded.

5. **Studies on PBC or PSC without AIH comparison** - This is specifically about AIH. Not excluded.

**Key Considerations:**
- The abstract is not available, which limits full assessment
- However, the title clearly indicates relevance to the review's objectives (PD-1 in AIH)
- Following the instruction to ""lean towards INCLUDE to avoid missing potentially relevant studies (high sensitivity approach)"" when information is insufficient",anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929,2026-01-28T07:31:31.686444

**Analysis of Available Information:**
- Title indicates: ""Different sites of xenoantigen delivery lead to a virally induced late-onset hepatitis in mice through molecular mimicry""
- No abstract is available
- No author, year, or journal information provided

**Evaluation Against Inclusion Criteria:**

1. **Original research articles**: The title suggests this is an original research study (animal study in mice) - likely meets this criterion

2. **Studies examining checkpoint receptors**: The title does NOT mention any of the specific checkpoint receptors (BTLA, CTLA-4, PD-1, TIGIT, VISTA, LAG-3, or CD200R). The focus appears to be on molecular mimicry and viral induction.

3. **Studies in AIH patients or animal models**: The study involves hepatitis in mice, but it appears to be a **virally-induced** hepatitis model through molecular mimicry, not specifically an autoimmune hepatitis model. This is a critical distinction.

4. **Comparison to controls**: Cannot determine from title alone

5. **Published in English**: Cannot determine, but title is in English

**Evaluation Against Exclusion Criteria:**
- Does not appear to be a review, editorial, or case report
- Not about ICI-DILI
- Not about PBC or PSC

**Key Concerns:**
- The study focuses on **virally-induced hepatitis** through molecular mimicry, which is mechanistically different from autoimmune hepatitis
- No mention of any checkpoint receptors in the title
- Without an abstract, I cannot confirm if this study examines checkpoint receptors or if the hepatitis model is relevant to AIH pathogenesis

**Decision Rationale:**
While the instruction suggests leaning toward INCLUDE when information is insufficient, this title provides enough information to suggest the study is about viral hepatitis mechanisms rather than autoimmune hepatitis and does not appear to involve checkpoint receptors. The focus on ""xenoantigen delivery"" and ""virally induced"" hepatitis suggests a different disease mechanism.",anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929,2026-01-28T07:31:42.973185
202,Drug-induced liver injury. Part II: Late complications and hepatotoxicity monitoring.,,,10.5114/ceh.2025.151868,exclude,"1. **Article Type Assessment**: The title suggests this is likely a review article or educational piece about drug-induced liver injury (DILI), specifically focusing on ""Part II"" which indicates it's part of a series. The phrase ""Late complications and hepatotoxicity monitoring"" suggests a broad overview rather than original research.

2. **Topic Relevance**: The citation is about drug-induced liver injury (DILI), not autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). While there is some overlap in liver pathology, DILI and AIH are distinct conditions with different etiologies.

3. **Checkpoint Inhibitor Context**: Although the exclusion criteria mention ""checkpoint inhibitor drug-induced liver injury (ICI-DILI),"" this article appears to be about general drug-induced liver injury, not specifically about checkpoint inhibitors or their receptors (BTLA, CTLA-4, PD-1, TIGIT, VISTA, LAG-3, CD200R).

4. **Lack of Abstract**: No abstract is available to verify whether this article contains any original data on checkpoint receptors in AIH or discusses AIH in relation to DILI.

5. **Article Format**: The title structure (""Part II"") and focus on monitoring suggests this is likely a review or educational article rather than original research, which would fall under exclusion criterion #2.

6. **Primary Focus Mismatch**: The study appears to focus on drug-induced liver injury complications and monitoring, not on the pathogenesis of autoimmune hepatitis or checkpoint receptor involvement in AIH.",anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929,2026-01-28T07:31:51.733248

**Analyzing the Title:**
- The study is about ""autoimmune hepatitis in mice"" - this directly relates to AIH in an animal model
- It discusses ""follicular helper T cells"" and their role in triggering AIH
- The title suggests this is original research on pathogenesis mechanisms

**Checking Inclusion Criteria:**
1. Original research articles (human or animal studies) - The title suggests this is an original research article using a mouse model ✓
2. Studies examining expression, function, or genetic variants of checkpoint receptors - UNCERTAIN from title alone; follicular helper T cells (Tfh) can express checkpoint receptors like PD-1, CTLA-4, and others, but this is not explicitly stated
3. Studies in AIH patients or animal models - Yes, explicitly mentions ""autoimmune hepatitis in mice"" ✓
4. Studies comparing AIH to controls - Cannot determine from title alone
5. Published in English - Likely yes (title is in English) ✓

**Checking Exclusion Criteria:**
1. Conference abstract without full text - Cannot determine from available information
2. Review article/editorial/commentary - Title suggests original research, not a review ✗
3. Case report <3 patients - This is a mouse study, not a case report ✗
4. Studies exclusively on ICI-DILI - No, this is about spontaneous/triggered AIH in mice ✗
5. Studies on PBC/PSC without AIH - No, explicitly about AIH ✗

**Key Considerations:**
- The abstract is not available, making it difficult to confirm whether checkpoint receptors are actually studied
- However, follicular helper T cells are known to express multiple checkpoint receptors (particularly PD-1, CTLA-4)
- The study is clearly about AIH pathogenesis in an animal model
- Following the instruction to ""lean towards INCLUDE to avoid missing potentially relevant studies (high sensitivity approach)"" when information is insufficient

221,Efficacy and Safety of Anti-PD-1/ PD-L1 Monotherapy for Metastatic Breast Cancer: Clinical Evidence.,,,10.3389/fphar.2021.653521,exclude,"1. **Study Topic Assessment**: The title clearly indicates this is a study about ""Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 Monotherapy for Metastatic Breast Cancer."" This is focused on cancer treatment, specifically breast cancer.

2. **Relevance to Review Objective**: The systematic review is focused on inhibitory checkpoint receptors in the context of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). While PD-1/PD-L1 is one of the checkpoint receptors of interest, this study is examining it in the context of cancer therapy (metastatic breast cancer), not autoimmune hepatitis.

3. **Disease Condition**: The study is about metastatic breast cancer, not autoimmune hepatitis or any liver disease. This does not meet inclusion criterion #3, which requires studies in patients with AIH or animal models of AIH.

4. **Exclusion Criteria Check**: While this is not explicitly about checkpoint inhibitor drug-induced liver injury (ICI-DILI), it is about cancer treatment with checkpoint inhibitors, which is outside the scope of the review's focus on AIH pathogenesis.

5. **Abstract Availability**: The abstract is not available, but the title is sufficiently clear to determine that this study is about cancer immunotherapy efficacy and safety, not about autoimmune hepatitis.

6. **Clinical Evidence Context**: The phrase ""Clinical Evidence"" in the title suggests this may be a review or synthesis of clinical data rather than original research, though this cannot be confirmed without the abstract.",anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929,2026-01-28T07:32:11.709517

However, without an abstract or additional information, I cannot definitively confirm this is original research versus a review or other article type.

2. **Checkpoint Receptors**: The title mentions ""Engineered Immunomodulatory Extracellular Vesicles"" and discusses ""innate and adaptive immunity."" However, there is no specific mention of any of the checkpoint receptors of interest (BTLA, CTLA-4, PD-1, TIGIT, VISTA, LAG-3, CD200R) in the title.

3. **Disease Focus**: The title mentions both ""cancer and autoimmunity"" broadly, but does NOT specifically mention autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) or any liver disease. The study appears to be about a general immunomodulatory approach rather than focused on AIH specifically.

4. **Abstract Availability**: The abstract is not available, which makes it difficult to determine if:
   - The study actually examines any of the specific checkpoint receptors
   - AIH is one of the autoimmune conditions studied
   - This contains original data on the topic of interest

5. **High Sensitivity Approach Consideration**: While the instruction suggests leaning towards INCLUDE when information is insufficient, the title provides enough information to suggest this study is likely about:
   - Engineered therapeutic vesicles (not expression/function studies of checkpoint receptors)
   - General autoimmunity and cancer (not specifically AIH)
   - No mention of the specific checkpoint molecules of interest

The title alone suggests this is likely not relevant to the specific research question about checkpoint receptors in AIH pathogenesis.",anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929,2026-01-28T07:32:21.493531

The focus appears to be on epidemiology and management rather than original research.

2. **Topic Relevance**: The title explicitly mentions ""Drug-induced Liver Injury"" which is distinct from autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). While drug-induced liver injury can sometimes mimic AIH, this appears to be about DILI in general, not specifically about checkpoint inhibitor-related liver injury or AIH.

3. **Checkpoint Receptors**: There is no mention in the title of any of the checkpoint receptors of interest (BTLA, CTLA-4, PD-1, TIGIT, VISTA, LAG-3, CD200R) or their ligands.

4. **Exclusion Criteria Check**:
   - The title suggests this may be a review article about epidemiology and management (Exclusion criterion #2)
   - The focus is on drug-induced liver injury, not autoimmune hepatitis
   - No abstract is available to confirm whether this contains original data or examines checkpoint receptors

5. **Inclusion Criteria Check**:
   - Does not appear to examine the checkpoint receptors listed
   - Does not appear to focus on AIH patients or animal models
   - The topic (DILI and RUCAM) is not aligned with the review objectives

However, without an abstract or additional information, I cannot definitively determine if this is an original research article, review article, or other publication type.

2. **Topic Relevance**: The title mentions ""autoimmune liver disease,"" which could include autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). This is potentially relevant to the review's focus on AIH.

3. **Checkpoint Receptor Relevance**: The title mentions ""genetic susceptibility"" which could potentially include genetic variants of checkpoint receptors (BTLA, CTLA-4, PD-1, TIGIT, VISTA, LAG-3, CD200R) that are part of the inclusion criteria.

298,Genetic variants associated with immune-mediated liver injury from checkpoint inhibitors.,,,10.1097/HC9.0000000000000518,exclude,"Let me evaluate this citation systematically against the inclusion and exclusion criteria:

**Title Analysis:**
The title is ""Genetic variants associated with immune-mediated liver injury from checkpoint inhibitors.""

Key observations:
1. The study focuses on ""immune-mediated liver injury from checkpoint inhibitors"" - this refers to checkpoint inhibitor drug-induced liver injury (ICI-DILI)
2. The study examines ""genetic variants"" which could relate to checkpoint receptors
3. However, the context is specifically drug-induced liver injury, not autoimmune hepatitis

**Checking Against Exclusion Criteria:**
- Exclusion criterion #4 specifically states: ""Studies exclusively on checkpoint inhibitor drug-induced liver injury (ICI-DILI)""
- The title clearly indicates this study is about liver injury FROM checkpoint inhibitors (drugs), not about checkpoint receptors in the pathogenesis of autoimmune hepatitis

**Checking Against Inclusion Criteria:**
- Criterion #3 requires ""Studies in patients with autoimmune hepatitis or animal models of AIH""
- This study appears to be about drug-induced liver injury, not AIH

**Key Distinction:**
There is an important difference between:
- Checkpoint inhibitor drug-induced liver injury (ICI-DILI): liver damage caused by cancer immunotherapy drugs
- AIH pathogenesis involving checkpoint receptors: the role of these receptors in the disease mechanism of autoimmune hepatitis

This study appears to fall into the first category, which is explicitly excluded.

**Abstract Availability:**
While the abstract is not available, the title is sufficiently clear to indicate this is about ICI-DILI, which is an exclusion criterion.",anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929,2026-01-28T07:34:04.744692
275,Genetics in autoimmune hepatitis.,,,10.1055/s-2002-35705,include,"1. **Publication Type Assessment**: The title ""Genetics in autoimmune hepatitis"" suggests this could be a review article, but without an abstract or additional information, I cannot definitively determine if this is original research or a review article.

2. **Topic Relevance**: The citation is clearly about autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), which matches the disease of interest in the review protocol.

3. **Checkpoint Receptor Content**: The title mentions ""genetics"" in AIH but does not specifically mention any of the checkpoint receptors (BTLA, CTLA-4, PD-1, TIGIT, VISTA, LAG-3, CD200R) or their ligands. However, genetic studies of AIH could potentially include genetic variants of these checkpoint receptors.

4. **Missing Information**:
   - No abstract is available
   - No author information
   - No year or journal information
   - Cannot determine if this is original research or a review
   - Cannot determine if checkpoint receptors are discussed

5. **Application of Protocol Guidance**: The instructions explicitly state: ""If the abstract is missing or insufficient to make a determination, lean towards INCLUDE to avoid missing potentially relevant studies (high sensitivity approach).""

6. **Potential Relevance**: Given that:
   - The study is about AIH (the disease of interest)
   - It focuses on genetics (which aligns with inclusion criterion #3 about genetic variants)
   - Checkpoint receptor genes could plausibly be included in a genetics study of AIH
   - We lack information to definitively exclude it

Meta-analyses typically synthesize data from multiple studies, but genome-wide meta-analyses (GWAS meta-analyses) are considered original research as they identify novel genetic associations.

2. **Disease Relevance**: The study explicitly focuses on ""autoimmune hepatitis type 1"" (AIH type 1), which directly matches the inclusion criteria requirement for studies in patients with autoimmune hepatitis.

3. **Checkpoint Receptor Relevance**: The study aims to identify ""susceptibility loci"" for AIH. While the title doesn't explicitly mention the specific checkpoint receptors listed (BTLA, CTLA-4, PD-1, TIGIT, VISTA, LAG-3, CD200R), genome-wide studies examine all genetic variants across the genome. Such studies could potentially identify genetic variants in or near genes encoding these checkpoint receptors or their ligands.

4. **Abstract Limitation**: The abstract is not available, which limits the ability to determine definitively whether checkpoint receptors are among the identified susceptibility loci. However, per the instructions, when information is insufficient, we should lean towards INCLUDE to maintain high sensitivity.

Con A-induced hepatitis is a well-established animal model of autoimmune hepatitis.

2. **Relevance to AIH**: Con A-induced hepatitis in mice is a commonly used experimental model for studying autoimmune hepatitis pathogenesis. This meets the inclusion criterion #3 regarding animal models of AIH.

3. **Checkpoint Receptor Relevance**: The study focuses on ""Glucose Metabolism Reprogramming of Regulatory T Cells."" While the title doesn't explicitly mention any of the specific checkpoint receptors listed (BTLA, CTLA-4, PD-1, TIGIT, VISTA, LAG-3, CD200R), regulatory T cells are closely associated with immune checkpoint pathways. However, without the abstract, I cannot confirm whether any of these specific molecules are examined.

4. **Missing Information**: The abstract is not available, which significantly limits the ability to determine:
   - Whether any of the specified checkpoint receptors are studied
   - The specific methodology used
   - Whether this is truly original research
   - The language of publication

5. **High Sensitivity Approach**: Given the instruction to lean towards INCLUDE when information is insufficient, and considering that:
   - This appears to be an original research article (based on title structure)

**Assessing Inclusion Criteria:**

1. **Original research articles**: The title suggests this is an original research study examining HLA alleles and immunoregulation in patients, which typically indicates original research rather than a review.

2. **Studies examining checkpoint receptors**: The title mentions ""impaired immunoregulation"" in autoimmune liver disease patients. While the title doesn't explicitly mention the specific checkpoint receptors (BTLA, CTLA-4, PD-1, TIGIT, VISTA, LAG-3, CD200R), immunoregulation is a broad term that could encompass these inhibitory checkpoint pathways. Without the abstract, I cannot confirm whether these specific molecules were studied.

3. **Studies in AIH patients or models**: The title explicitly mentions ""juvenile autoimmune liver disease,"" which would include autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). This meets the criterion.

4. **Comparison to controls**: The study includes ""first-degree relatives"" which could serve as a comparison group, though it's unclear if healthy controls are included.

5. **Published in English**: Cannot be determined from the information provided, but the title is in English.

**Assessing Exclusion Criteria:**

1. **Conference abstract**: Cannot determine from the information provided
2. **Review article/editorial**: The title structure suggests original research
3. **Case report <3 patients**: Unlikely given the plural ""patients"" and inclusion of relatives
4. **Exclusively ICI-DILI**: No indication of this
5. **PBC/PSC without AIH**: The focus is on autoimmune liver disease, likely including AIH

**Key Uncertainty**: The abstract is not available, making it impossible to confirm whether the specific checkpoint receptors of interest were actually studied. However, the study is clearly about autoimmune liver disease and immunoregulation, which is relevant to the review's scope.

**Decision Approach**: Following the instruction to ""lean towards INCLUDE to avoid missing potentially relevant studies (high sensitivity approach)"" when information is insufficient, and given that this study is about immunoregulation in autoimmune liver disease (which could include checkpoint receptor pathways), I should include it for full-text review.",anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929,2026-01-28T07:34:47.284983

2. **Population**: The study explicitly mentions ""autoimmune hepatitis patients,"" which directly matches the inclusion criteria (criterion 3).

3. **Relevant biomarkers**: The title mentions ""HLA and Non-HLA gene polymorphisms."" While HLA genes are mentioned, the ""Non-HLA gene polymorphisms"" could potentially include the checkpoint receptors of interest (BTLA, CTLA-4, PD-1, TIGIT, VISTA, LAG-3, CD200R) as these would fall under non-HLA genes. The title does not specify which non-HLA genes were examined.

4. **Abstract availability**: No abstract is provided, making it impossible to determine:
   - Which specific non-HLA genes were studied
   - Whether any checkpoint receptors were included
   - The study design and methodology

**Checking Inclusion Criteria:**

1. **Original research articles** - The title suggests this is an original research study examining hepatic expression patterns. No indication it's a review or commentary.

2. **Studies examining expression, function, or genetic variants of specified checkpoint receptors** - YES. The study explicitly examines PD-1 and PD-L1 (its ligand), which are among the checkpoint receptors listed in the protocol (PD-1 is specifically mentioned).

3. **Studies in patients with autoimmune hepatitis or animal models** - YES. The title clearly states ""children with autoimmune hepatitis.""

4. **Studies comparing AIH to healthy controls or other liver disease controls** - UNCERTAIN from title alone, but the mention of ""relation to treatment response"" suggests comparative analysis.

5. **Published in English** - Cannot determine definitively, but title is in English.

**Checking Exclusion Criteria:**

1. **Conference abstracts without full text** - Cannot determine from the information provided.

2. **Review articles, editorials, commentaries, letters without original data** - The title structure suggests original research examining expression patterns and clinical correlations.

1. **Study Type**: The title indicates this is an ""observational, retrospective, pharmacovigilance study"" - this appears to be original research, which meets inclusion criterion #1.

2. **Topic Focus**: The study examines ""hepatitis-related adverse events associated with immune checkpoint inhibitors in cancer patients"" using the FAERS database (FDA Adverse Event Reporting System).

3. **Relevance to Checkpoint Receptors**: The study involves immune checkpoint inhibitors, which are drugs that target checkpoint receptors (like PD-1, CTLA-4, etc.). However, this appears to be about adverse events FROM these drugs.

1. **Title Analysis**: The title ""Hepatobiliary Adverse Events Linked to Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors: A Real-World Pharmacovigilance Analysis Using FAERS Data"" suggests this study is about adverse events caused by immune checkpoint inhibitor drugs.

2. **Study Focus**: The key phrase ""adverse events linked to immune checkpoint inhibitors"" indicates this is about drug-induced liver injury from checkpoint inhibitor therapy, not about the role of checkpoint receptors in autoimmune hepatitis pathogenesis.

3. **Exclusion Criteria #4**: The protocol specifically excludes ""Studies exclusively on checkpoint inhibitor drug-induced liver injury (ICI-DILI)."" This study appears to be examining hepatobiliary adverse events from immune checkpoint inhibitor drugs, which falls under ICI-DILI.

4. **Study Type**: This appears to be a pharmacovigilance study using FAERS (FDA Adverse Event Reporting System) data, which analyzes adverse drug reactions rather than investigating the pathogenesis of autoimmune hepatitis.

5. **Relevance to Research Question**: The review is interested in whether checkpoint receptors (BTLA, CTLA-4, PD-1, etc.) are involved in AIH pathogenesis. This study appears to focus on adverse events from blocking these receptors therapeutically, which is a different research question.

1. **Title Analysis**: ""Histologic patterns of liver injury induced by anti-PD-1 therapy""
   - This clearly indicates the study is about liver injury caused by anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor therapy
   - The focus is on drug-induced liver injury from immunotherapy

2. **Checking Exclusion Criteria**:
   - Exclusion criterion #4 specifically states: ""Studies exclusively on checkpoint inhibitor drug-induced liver injury (ICI-DILI)""
   - This title explicitly indicates the study is about liver injury ""induced by anti-PD-1 therapy,"" which is checkpoint inhibitor drug-induced liver injury (ICI-DILI)

3. **Checking Inclusion Criteria**:
   - While the study does involve PD-1 (one of the checkpoint receptors of interest), it appears to be studying the adverse effects of anti-PD-1 therapy rather than the role of PD-1 in autoimmune hepatitis pathogenesis
   - There is no indication this study involves autoimmune hepatitis patients or AIH animal models (inclusion criterion #3)

4. **Abstract Availability**: No abstract is available, which creates some uncertainty. However, the title is quite clear and specific about the focus being on drug-induced liver injury from anti-PD-1 therapy.

5. **Alignment with Review Objective**: The review aims to understand checkpoint receptors in AIH pathogenesis, not the hepatotoxicity of checkpoint inhibitor drugs used in cancer treatment.",anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929,2026-01-28T07:36:39.540106
240,IFN-γ is reciprocally involved in the concurrent development of organ-specific autoimmunity in the liver and stomach.,,,10.3109/08916934.2011.616559,exclude,"Let me evaluate this citation systematically against the inclusion and exclusion criteria:

**Available Information:**
- Title mentions IFN-γ and organ-specific autoimmunity in liver and stomach
- No abstract available
- No author, year, or journal information provided

**Evaluation against Inclusion Criteria:**

1. **Original research articles**: The title suggests this could be an original research article (uses language like ""is reciprocally involved"" suggesting investigation), but cannot confirm without abstract or full text.

2. **Studies examining checkpoint receptors**: The title mentions IFN-γ, which is NOT one of the specified checkpoint receptors (BTLA, CTLA-4, PD-1, TIGIT, VISTA, LAG-3, CD200R). IFN-γ is a cytokine, not an inhibitory checkpoint receptor.

3. **Studies in AIH patients or models**: The title mentions ""autoimmunity in the liver"" but does not specifically mention autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). It could be AIH, but it could also be other forms of autoimmune liver disease.

4. **Comparison to controls**: Cannot determine from title alone.

5. **Published in English**: Cannot determine, but title is in English.

**Evaluation against Exclusion Criteria:**
- Cannot determine publication type without more information
- The study appears to involve both liver and stomach autoimmunity, not exclusively other conditions

**Key Issues:**
1. The primary focus is on IFN-γ, which is NOT one of the checkpoint receptors specified in the protocol
2. ""Autoimmunity in the liver"" is vague and may not specifically refer to AIH
3. Insufficient information to make a definitive determination

Given the instruction to lean towards INCLUDE when information is insufficient, but considering that the main molecule (IFN-γ) is clearly not within the scope of checkpoint receptors being reviewed, this appears to be outside the scope of the systematic review.",anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929,2026-01-28T07:36:50.005628
316,Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor-induced Fanconi Syndrome.,,,10.7759/cureus.7686,exclude,"1. **Article Type Assessment**: The title suggests this is likely a case report or case series about Fanconi Syndrome induced by immune checkpoint inhibitors. Without an abstract or additional information, I cannot confirm the article type definitively.

2. **Topic Relevance**:
   - The title mentions ""Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor-induced"" which suggests this is about adverse effects of checkpoint inhibitor drugs (ICI-DILI or other immune-related adverse events)
   - Fanconi Syndrome is a kidney disorder affecting the proximal tubules, not a liver condition
   - This does not appear to be about autoimmune hepatitis (AIH)

3. **Exclusion Criteria Application**:
   - Exclusion criterion #4 specifically states: ""Studies exclusively on checkpoint inhibitor drug-induced liver injury (ICI-DILI)""
   - This study appears to be about checkpoint inhibitor drug-induced kidney injury (Fanconi Syndrome), not about the pathogenesis of AIH
   - The study does not appear to examine the checkpoint receptors (BTLA, CTLA-4, PD-1, TIGIT, VISTA, LAG-3, CD200R) in the context of AIH pathogenesis

4. **Inclusion Criteria Assessment**:
   - Does not appear to be about AIH patients or animal models of AIH (criterion #3)
   - Does not appear to examine checkpoint receptors in the context of AIH pathogenesis (criterion #2)

According to the exclusion criteria #2, review articles without original data should be excluded.

2. **Topic Relevance**: The article focuses on:
   - Immune checkpoint inhibitors in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
   - Hepatic-related side effects of these inhibitors

3. **Comparison to Inclusion Criteria**:
   - The study appears to be about checkpoint inhibitors as cancer therapy and their side effects, not about the role of checkpoint receptors in autoimmune hepatitis pathogenesis
   - While it mentions ""hepatic-related side effects,"" this likely refers to drug-induced liver injury from checkpoint inhibitor therapy

4. **Comparison to Exclusion Criteria**:
   - Exclusion criterion #2: This is explicitly identified as a review article
   - Exclusion criterion #4: The focus on checkpoint inhibitors in HCC and their side effects suggests this is about checkpoint inhibitor drug-induced liver injury (ICI-DILI), which is explicitly excluded
   - The study does not appear to focus on autoimmune hepatitis as a primary disease entity

This is focused on cancer treatment (renal cell carcinoma), not autoimmune hepatitis.

2. **Disease Focus**: The study appears to be about renal cell carcinoma (a kidney cancer), which is completely unrelated to autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). There is no indication in the title that this study involves:
   - Autoimmune hepatitis patients
   - Animal models of AIH
   - Liver disease of any kind

3. **Checkpoint Inhibitor Context**: While the study does mention immune checkpoint inhibitors, it appears to be in the context of cancer immunotherapy treatment (using checkpoint inhibitors as drugs to treat cancer), not in the context of studying checkpoint receptors in the pathogenesis of autoimmune disease.

4. **Exclusion Criteria Check**:
   - The study appears to be about cancer treatment, not AIH
   - Even though checkpoint inhibitors are mentioned, they are being used as therapeutic agents for cancer, not being studied for their role in AIH pathogenesis
   - No abstract is available, but the title is sufficiently clear about the focus

5. **Inclusion Criteria Check**:
   - Does not appear to involve AIH patients or animal models (Criterion 3 not met)
   - Does not appear to compare AIH to controls (Criterion 4 not met)

1. **Publication type**: The title indicates this is a case report (""A case of lung cancer treatment""). The exclusion criteria state that case reports with fewer than 3 patients should be excluded. This appears to be a single case report.

2. **Subject matter**: The title clearly indicates this is about ""Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-induced hepatitis"" - this is drug-induced liver injury from checkpoint inhibitor therapy, not autoimmune hepatitis (AIH).

3. **Exclusion criterion #4**: The exclusion criteria specifically state: ""Studies exclusively on checkpoint inhibitor drug-induced liver injury (ICI-DILI)"" should be excluded. This study is explicitly about ICI-induced hepatitis, which falls under ICI-DILI.

4. **Disease focus**: The study is about a lung cancer patient who developed hepatitis as a side effect of checkpoint inhibitor treatment. This is fundamentally different from studying the role of checkpoint receptors in the pathogenesis of autoimmune hepatitis. The study is examining an adverse drug reaction, not the underlying disease mechanism of AIH.

5. **Relevance to research question**: The review aims to understand whether checkpoint receptors are involved in AIH pathogenesis. This case report is about iatrogenic liver injury from checkpoint inhibitor drugs, which is a different clinical entity.

The citation meets two clear exclusion criteria: it is a single case report (fewer than 3 patients) AND it is exclusively about checkpoint inhibitor drug-induced liver injury.",anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929,2026-01-28T07:37:26.237450

**Assessment of Inclusion Criteria:**
1. Original research articles - UNCERTAIN: The title suggests this could be a review article given the broad phrasing ""implications in autoimmunity and autoimmune hepatitis,"" but without an abstract or full text, I cannot confirm whether it contains original data.

2. Studies examining checkpoint receptors - YES: The title explicitly mentions ""immune inhibitory proteins"" which aligns with checkpoint receptors, and specifically mentions autoimmune hepatitis.

3. Studies in AIH patients or models - YES: The title specifically mentions ""autoimmune hepatitis.""

4. Comparison groups - UNCERTAIN: Cannot determine from title alone.

5. Published in English - UNCERTAIN: Cannot determine, but title is in English.

**Assessment of Exclusion Criteria:**
1. Conference abstract - UNCERTAIN: No information provided about publication type.

2. Review articles, editorials, etc. - POSSIBLE: The broad title ""implications in autoimmunity and autoimmune hepatitis"" and the phrase ""pathogenic and therapeutic implications"" could suggest this is a review article rather than original research. However, this cannot be confirmed without the abstract.

3. Case reports <3 patients - Unlikely based on title scope.

4. Exclusively ICI-DILI - NO: Title mentions autoimmunity and AIH broadly, not drug-induced injury.

5. PBC/PSC without AIH - NO: AIH is explicitly mentioned.

**Key Issue:** The abstract is not available, making it impossible to definitively determine if this is original research or a review article. The protocol instructs that when information is insufficient, I should lean towards INCLUDE to maintain high sensitivity and avoid missing potentially relevant studies.",anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929,2026-01-28T07:37:35.360932

**Title Analysis:**
The title mentions ""Immune signatures in variant syndromes of primary biliary cholangitis and autoimmune hepatitis."" This suggests the study examines both PBC and AIH, specifically variant syndromes (overlap syndromes).

**Checking Inclusion Criteria:**
1. Original research articles - The title suggests this could be original research examining ""immune signatures,"" but without an abstract, I cannot confirm this definitively.
2. Studies examining checkpoint receptors - The term ""immune signatures"" could potentially include checkpoint receptors, but this is not explicitly stated in the title.
3. Studies in AIH patients - Yes, the title explicitly mentions autoimmune hepatitis.
4. Comparison groups - The title mentions both PBC and AIH, suggesting comparative analysis.
5. Language - Unknown, but likely English given the title.

**Checking Exclusion Criteria:**
1. Conference abstract - Cannot determine from the information provided.
2. Review article/editorial - The title suggests original research (""immune signatures""), but cannot confirm without abstract.
3. Case report <3 patients - Unlikely given the title suggests a broader study of ""variant syndromes.""
4. Exclusively ICI-DILI - No, this appears to be about primary autoimmune conditions.
5. PBC/PSC without AIH comparison - The title explicitly includes AIH, so this exclusion does not apply.

**Key Considerations:**
- The abstract is not available, making it difficult to determine if checkpoint receptors are actually studied
- The title includes AIH, which meets a core inclusion criterion
- ""Immune signatures"" is a broad term that could potentially include checkpoint receptor expression
- Following the instruction to ""lean towards INCLUDE to avoid missing potentially relevant studies (high sensitivity approach)"" when information is insufficient",anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929,2026-01-28T07:37:45.651137

**Title Analysis:**
The title is ""Immune-Mediated Hepatitis During Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor cancer Immunotherapy: Lessons From Autoimmune Hepatitis and Liver Immunology.""

Key observations:
1. The primary focus appears to be on ""immune-mediated hepatitis during immune checkpoint inhibitor cancer immunotherapy"" - this suggests the main topic is checkpoint inhibitor drug-induced liver injury (ICI-DILI)
2. The phrase ""Lessons From Autoimmune Hepatitis"" suggests AIH is discussed as a comparison or framework, but may not be the primary subject of original research
3. No abstract is available to clarify the content

**Applying Exclusion Criteria:**
- Exclusion criterion #4 specifically states: ""Studies exclusively on checkpoint inhibitor drug-induced liver injury (ICI-DILI)"" should be excluded
- The title strongly suggests this is primarily about ICI-DILI, with AIH mentioned as a comparative reference point

**Applying Inclusion Criteria:**
- Cannot determine if this is original research or a review article (criterion #1 and exclusion criterion #2)
- Cannot determine if it examines the specific checkpoint receptors in AIH patients (criteria #2-3)
- The title suggests it may be a review or educational piece drawing ""lessons"" rather than presenting original data on AIH

**Missing Information:**
Without an abstract, authors, or journal information, there is significant uncertainty. However, the title structure (""Lessons From..."") typically indicates a review, perspective, or educational article rather than original research.",anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929,2026-01-28T07:37:55.723891
222,Immune-mediated hepatitis caused by toripalimab: A case report.,,,10.5414/CP204647,exclude,"1. **Study Type Assessment**: The title indicates this is a ""case report"" about immune-mediated hepatitis caused by toripalimab (an immune checkpoint inhibitor drug).

2. **Number of Patients**: Case reports typically involve 1-2 patients. The exclusion criteria specify that ""case reports with fewer than 3 patients"" should be excluded. Without access to the full text, it's reasonable to assume this is a single case or very small case series (fewer than 3 patients), which is typical for case reports.

3. **Subject Matter**: The study is about ""immune-mediated hepatitis caused by toripalimab."" Toripalimab is a PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor drug. This appears to be about checkpoint inhibitor drug-induced liver injury (ICI-DILI).

4. **Exclusion Criteria Match**:
   - Exclusion criterion #3: ""Case reports with fewer than 3 patients"" - This appears to apply
   - Exclusion criterion #4: ""Studies exclusively on checkpoint inhibitor drug-induced liver injury (ICI-DILI)"" - This clearly applies, as the title explicitly states the hepatitis was ""caused by toripalimab"" (a checkpoint inhibitor drug)

5. **Inclusion Criteria Assessment**: While the study involves a checkpoint inhibitor (PD-1), it is about drug-induced hepatitis, not autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) as a primary disease entity. The focus is on adverse effects of checkpoint inhibitor therapy, not the pathogenesis of AIH itself.

6. **Relevance to Review Objective**: The review aims to understand checkpoint receptors in AIH pathogenesis, not drug-induced liver injury from checkpoint inhibitor therapy.",anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929,2026-01-28T07:38:08.019867

**Title Analysis:**
The title indicates this study is about ""Immune-mediated liver injury caused by immune checkpoint inhibitors"" and compares it to autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). This suggests the study's primary focus is on checkpoint inhibitor drug-induced liver injury (ICI-DILI).

**Applying Exclusion Criteria:**

1. Conference abstracts without full text - Cannot determine from the information provided
2. Review articles, editorials, commentaries, letters without original data - Cannot determine, but the title suggests it may be an original research article (uses ""exhibits"" suggesting observational findings)
3. Case reports with fewer than 3 patients - Unlikely given the comparative nature suggested by the title
4. **Studies exclusively on checkpoint inhibitor drug-induced liver injury (ICI-DILI)** - This is the critical criterion. The title explicitly states the study is about ""immune-mediated liver injury caused by immune checkpoint inhibitors""
5. Studies on PBC or PSC without AIH comparison - Not applicable

**Key Issue:**
Exclusion criterion #4 specifically excludes ""Studies exclusively on checkpoint inhibitor drug-induced liver injury (ICI-DILI)."" The title clearly indicates this study is about ICI-DILI, though it does compare it to AIH. The comparison to AIH appears to be for the purpose of distinguishing ICI-DILI from AIH, rather than studying AIH pathogenesis itself.

**Applying Inclusion Criteria:**
The study does not appear to examine the role of checkpoint receptors IN the pathogenesis of AIH, but rather examines liver injury CAUSED BY checkpoint inhibitor drugs, which is a different phenomenon.

**Conclusion:**
This appears to be a study focused on drug-induced liver injury from checkpoint inhibitor therapy, which falls under exclusion criterion #4.",anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929,2026-01-28T07:38:17.642782

**Available Information:**
- Title: ""Immune-mediated liver injury following COVID-19 vaccination""
- No abstract available
- No author, year, or journal information provided

**Analysis:**

1. **Topic Relevance:** The title indicates this study is about immune-mediated liver injury related to COVID-19 vaccination. This appears to be about vaccine-induced liver injury rather than autoimmune hepatitis specifically.

2. **Relationship to AIH:** While some cases of immune-mediated liver injury post-vaccination could potentially be AIH or AIH-like conditions, the title does not specifically mention autoimmune hepatitis. However, without an abstract, I cannot determine if:
   - The study includes AIH patients
   - The study examines checkpoint receptors (BTLA, CTLA-4, PD-1, TIGIT, VISTA, LAG-3, CD200R)
   - This is original research or a review/case report

3. **Potential Exclusions:**
   - This could be a case report with <3 patients (exclusion criterion #3)
   - This could be a review article without original data (exclusion criterion #2)
   - The study may not examine any of the specified checkpoint receptors (inclusion criterion #2)
   - The study may not involve AIH patients or animal models (inclusion criterion #3)

4. **Uncertainty:** The complete lack of an abstract and other bibliographic details makes it impossible to definitively determine if this meets inclusion criteria. The title alone suggests this is likely NOT about the checkpoint receptors in AIH pathogenesis, but rather about a different type of immune-mediated liver injury.

5. **High Sensitivity Approach Consideration:** While the instructions suggest leaning toward INCLUDE when information is insufficient, the title itself provides strong indication that this is about vaccination-related liver injury rather than AIH pathogenesis and checkpoint receptors.",anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929,2026-01-28T07:38:29.569146

**Title Analysis:**
The title mentions ""Immune-related adverse reactions in the hepatobiliary system"" and ""check-point inhibitors"" with ""diverse histological changes."" This suggests the study is about adverse effects from checkpoint inhibitor drugs affecting the liver.

**Applying Exclusion Criteria:**

1. Conference abstracts without full text - Cannot determine from the information provided
2. Review articles, editorials, commentaries, letters without original data - Cannot determine definitively, but the mention of ""highlight diverse histological changes"" suggests it may contain original observations
3. Case reports with fewer than 3 patients - Cannot determine
4. **Studies exclusively on checkpoint inhibitor drug-induced liver injury (ICI-DILI)** - This is the critical criterion. The title strongly suggests this is about ""immune-related adverse reactions"" from checkpoint inhibitors, which is essentially ICI-DILI (checkpoint inhibitor drug-induced liver injury)
5. Studies on PBC or PSC without AIH comparison - Not applicable

**Applying Inclusion Criteria:**

The study does not appear to be about:
- Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) as a primary disease
- The pathogenesis of AIH
- Expression or function of checkpoint receptors in AIH patients or AIH animal models

Instead, it appears to focus on adverse drug reactions (liver injury) caused by checkpoint inhibitor therapy, which is specifically excluded by Exclusion Criterion #4.

**Title Analysis:**
The title is ""Immune-related hepatitis related to checkpoint inhibitors: Clinical and prognostic factors.""

Key observations:
1. The study focuses on ""immune-related hepatitis related to checkpoint inhibitors"" - this appears to be about checkpoint inhibitor drug-induced liver injury (ICI-DILI)
2. The title does not mention autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) specifically
3. The focus seems to be on hepatitis as an adverse effect of checkpoint inhibitor therapy, not on the role of checkpoint receptors in AIH pathogenesis

**Applying Exclusion Criteria:**
- Exclusion criterion #4 specifically states: ""Studies exclusively on checkpoint inhibitor drug-induced liver injury (ICI-DILI)""
- This title strongly suggests the study is about ICI-DILI, which is hepatotoxicity caused by checkpoint inhibitor drugs used in cancer treatment
- This is fundamentally different from studying whether checkpoint receptors are involved in AIH pathogenesis

**Applying Inclusion Criteria:**
- The study does not appear to examine checkpoint receptors in AIH patients or animal models
- It appears to focus on adverse drug reactions rather than AIH disease mechanisms

**Limitations:**
- No abstract is available to confirm the exact content
- However, the title is quite specific and clearly indicates the focus is on checkpoint inhibitor-related hepatitis (an adverse drug effect)

**Assessing Inclusion Criteria:**

1. **Original research articles**: The title suggests this is an original research study examining kinetics of biomarkers in patients, which implies original data collection and analysis.

2. **Studies examining checkpoint receptors**: Yes - the study explicitly mentions PD-1 (programmed cell death 1), which is one of the checkpoint receptors specified in the protocol.

3. **Studies in patients with AIH**: Yes - the title clearly states ""patients with newly diagnosed autoimmune hepatitis.""

4. **Studies comparing AIH to controls**: The title mentions examining kinetics in AIH patients, though it's unclear if there are control groups. However, the focus on ""newly diagnosed"" patients and drug effects suggests longitudinal or comparative analysis.

5. **Published in English**: The title is in English, suggesting the article is in English.

**Assessing Exclusion Criteria:**

1. **Conference abstracts**: Cannot determine from the information provided, but the title suggests a full research article.

2. **Review articles, editorials, etc.**: The title structure suggests an original research study, not a review or commentary.

3. **Case reports <3 patients**: The use of plural ""patients"" suggests more than 3 patients.

4. **Studies exclusively on ICI-DILI**: No - this is about autoimmune hepatitis patients receiving immunosuppressive treatment, not checkpoint inhibitor drug-induced liver injury.

5. **PBC/PSC without AIH**: Not applicable - the study is specifically on AIH.

1. **Original research articles**: The title suggests this is likely an original research article (uses ""Increased...Expression"" which implies empirical findings), but cannot be confirmed without abstract.

2. **Studies examining checkpoint molecules**: The title explicitly mentions ""Immune Checkpoint Molecules"" - this directly aligns with the review's focus on inhibitory checkpoint receptors.

3. **Studies in AIH patients or models**: The title mentions ""Autoimmune Liver Disease"" which would include autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). However, it's not specific to AIH alone.

4. **Comparison to controls**: Cannot determine from title alone.

4. **Exclusively ICI-DILI**: No indication of this; title suggests naturally occurring autoimmune disease.
5. **PBC/PSC without AIH**: The term ""autoimmune liver disease"" is broad and could include PBC/PSC, but likely also includes AIH.

**Key Considerations:**
- The abstract is missing, making definitive determination difficult
- The title is highly relevant to the review objectives (checkpoint molecules in autoimmune liver disease)
- Following the instruction to ""lean towards INCLUDE to avoid missing potentially relevant studies (high sensitivity approach)"" when information is insufficient",anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929,2026-01-28T07:39:10.699846

3. **Autoimmune Hepatitis (AIH) Connection**: The title mentions ""hepatitis associated with immune checkpoint inhibitors,"" which is a distinct clinical entity from autoimmune hepatitis. ICI-DILI is a drug-induced condition that occurs as an adverse effect of cancer immunotherapy, not the spontaneous autoimmune hepatitis that is the focus of this review.

4. **Checkpoint Receptor Expression/Function**: While the study involves immune checkpoint inhibitors, it appears to focus on adverse events (fatal hepatitis) rather than examining the expression, function, or genetic variants of checkpoint receptors in AIH patients or models (Inclusion Criterion #2).

5. **Study Population**: There is no indication that this study examines patients with autoimmune hepatitis or animal models of AIH (Inclusion Criterion #3).

While the title doesn't explicitly mention the specific checkpoint receptors listed (BTLA, CTLA-4, PD-1, TIGIT, VISTA, LAG-3, CD200R), the term ""integrative molecular profiling"" suggests a comprehensive analysis that could potentially include these molecules, as they are important regulators of T cell function.

4. **Abstract availability**: No abstract is available, which limits the ability to confirm whether specific checkpoint receptors are examined. However, per the instructions, when abstract information is insufficient, I should lean towards INCLUDE to maintain high sensitivity.

5. **Exclusion criteria check**:
   - Not identifiable as a conference abstract without full text
   - Not identifiable as a review, editorial, or commentary based on the title
   - Not a case report (molecular profiling suggests larger study)
   - Not exclusively about checkpoint inhibitor drug-induced liver injury
   - Specifically about AIH, not PBC or PSC

6. **Rationale for inclusion**: Given that this is molecular profiling of T cells in AIH, and checkpoint receptors are key molecules expressed on T cells that regulate their function in autoimmune diseases, there is a reasonable probability this study examines one or more of the checkpoint receptors of interest.",anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929,2026-01-28T07:39:30.225629

**Available Information:**
- Title: ""Liver homing of clinical grade Tregs after therapeutic infusion in patients with autoimmune hepatitis""
- No abstract available
- No author, year, or journal information provided

**Evaluation against Inclusion Criteria:**

1. **Original research articles**: The title suggests this is likely an original research study describing therapeutic infusion of Tregs in AIH patients, which would be original research.

2. **Studies examining checkpoint receptors**: The study focuses on Tregs (regulatory T cells). While Tregs are closely related to checkpoint biology (they express CTLA-4, PD-1, and other checkpoint molecules as part of their regulatory function), the title does not explicitly mention any of the specific checkpoint receptors listed (BTLA, CTLA-4, PD-1, TIGIT, VISTA, LAG-3, CD200R).

3. **Studies in AIH patients**: YES - explicitly mentions ""patients with autoimmune hepatitis""

4. **Comparison to controls**: Cannot determine from title alone

5. **Published in English**: Title is in English, likely the full article is too

4. **ICI-DILI exclusively**: No - this is about AIH, not drug-induced liver injury
5. **PBC/PSC without AIH**: No - explicitly about AIH

**Key Consideration:**
The main uncertainty is whether this study actually examines the checkpoint receptors of interest. Tregs are relevant to checkpoint biology, and studies of Tregs in AIH often examine checkpoint receptor expression. However, without an abstract, I cannot confirm this connection.

Given the instruction to ""lean towards INCLUDE to avoid missing potentially relevant studies (high sensitivity approach)"" when information is insufficient, and considering that Treg studies in AIH frequently involve checkpoint receptor analysis, I should err on the side of inclusion.",anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929,2026-01-28T08:55:57.698502

   - Exclusion criterion #4 specifically states: ""Studies exclusively on checkpoint inhibitor drug-induced liver injury (ICI-DILI)""
   - The title strongly suggests this is about liver toxicity FROM immune checkpoint inhibitors (as drugs), not about the role of checkpoint receptors IN autoimmune hepatitis pathogenesis

3. **Checking Inclusion Criteria**:
   - The study does not appear to be examining checkpoint receptors in the context of AIH pathogenesis
   - It appears to focus on drug-induced liver injury from checkpoint inhibitor therapies
   - No indication this involves AIH patients or animal models of AIH

4. **Abstract Availability**: While the abstract is not available, the title is quite clear and specific about the focus being on liver toxicity as a side effect of checkpoint inhibitor drugs.

5. **Context**: The review is looking for studies on checkpoint receptors' role IN autoimmune hepatitis pathogenesis, not studies about liver damage CAUSED BY checkpoint inhibitor drugs used as cancer therapy.

**Title Analysis:**
The title is ""Lymphocyte Profile and Immune Checkpoint Expression in Drug-Induced Liver Injury: An Immunophenotyping Study.""

Key observations:
1. The study examines ""immune checkpoint expression"" - which aligns with the review's focus on checkpoint receptors
2. However, the study is specifically about ""Drug-Induced Liver Injury"" (DILI)
3. The study appears to be an immunophenotyping study, suggesting original research

**Checking Against Exclusion Criteria:**

Exclusion criterion #4 states: ""Studies exclusively on checkpoint inhibitor drug-induced liver injury (ICI-DILI)""

The title mentions ""Drug-Induced Liver Injury"" but does not specify whether this is:
- Checkpoint inhibitor drug-induced liver injury (ICI-DILI) - which would be excluded
- General drug-induced liver injury (DILI) from other medications - which is not explicitly excluded

**Checking Against Inclusion Criteria:**
- Appears to be original research (immunophenotyping study)
- Studies immune checkpoint expression (criterion #2)
- However, it's about drug-induced liver injury, not autoimmune hepatitis (fails criterion #3)

**Critical Issue:**
The study is about drug-induced liver injury, not autoimmune hepatitis. While drug-induced liver injury can sometimes mimic AIH, this study does not appear to focus on AIH patients or AIH animal models based on the title.

2. **Disease Focus**: The study is clearly about uveal melanoma (a type of eye cancer), NOT autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). This is a fundamental mismatch with the inclusion criteria which specifically requires studies on AIH patients or animal models of AIH.

3. **Checkpoint Inhibitors Context**: While the study does involve CTLA-4 and PD-1 (which are checkpoint receptors of interest in the review protocol), they are being used as THERAPEUTIC AGENTS to treat cancer, not being studied in the context of autoimmune hepatitis pathogenesis.

4. **Exclusion Criteria Check**:
   - This appears to be a case report (likely fewer than 3 patients based on the title mentioning ""a"" patient showing response)

The phrase ""from diagnosis to potential therapeutic targets"" is characteristic of review article titles that synthesize existing knowledge rather than present original research.

2. **Topic Relevance**: The article is about autoimmune liver diseases, which would include autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). However, the focus is on microRNAs, not on the specific checkpoint receptors listed in the inclusion criteria (BTLA, CTLA-4, PD-1, TIGIT, VISTA, LAG-3, CD200R).

The title mentions ""anti-programmed cell death-1 antibody as a serological marker for type 1 autoimmune hepatitis."" This indicates:
- It involves PD-1 (programmed cell death-1), which is one of the checkpoint receptors specified in the inclusion criteria
- It focuses on type 1 autoimmune hepatitis (AIH)
- It appears to be a multicenter validation study, suggesting original research

**Checking Inclusion Criteria:**
1. Original research articles - The term ""validation study"" suggests this is original research (likely)
2. Studies examining checkpoint receptors - Yes, it examines PD-1 (anti-PD-1 antibodies)
3. Studies in AIH patients - Yes, explicitly mentions type 1 autoimmune hepatitis
4. Comparison groups - ""Multicenter validation"" suggests appropriate controls, though not explicitly stated
5. Language - Cannot determine from available information, but should assume English unless stated otherwise

**Checking Exclusion Criteria:**
1. Conference abstract - No indication this is an abstract only

168,Novel homozygous AIRE mutation in a German patient with severe APECED.,,,10.1515/jpem.2008.21.10.1003,exclude,"1. **Study Type Assessment**: The title suggests this is a case report describing a single patient (""a German patient"") with a novel homozygous AIRE mutation and APECED (Autoimmune Polyendocrinopathy-Candidiasis-Ectodermal Dystrophy).

2. **Relevance to Review Topic**:
   - The study focuses on AIRE mutation and APECED, not specifically on autoimmune hepatitis (AIH)
   - APECED is a rare autoimmune syndrome that can involve multiple organs, and while hepatitis can be a component, this is not the primary focus
   - The title does not mention any of the checkpoint receptors of interest (BTLA, CTLA-4, PD-1, TIGIT, VISTA, LAG-3, CD200R)

3. **Exclusion Criteria Check**:
   - This appears to be a case report with only one patient (n=1), which falls under exclusion criterion #3: ""Case reports with fewer than 3 patients""
   - No abstract is available to confirm whether checkpoint receptors were studied or whether AIH was specifically investigated

4. **Inclusion Criteria Check**:
   - Does not appear to examine the checkpoint receptors specified in criterion #2
   - Does not appear to focus on autoimmune hepatitis specifically (criterion #3)
   - The study is about AIRE mutations and APECED, which is a different condition

5. **Missing Information**: While the abstract is not available, the title is sufficiently clear that this is a single-patient case report about AIRE mutation and APECED, not about checkpoint receptors in AIH.",anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929,2026-01-28T09:37:49.604210
186,Overview of hepatocellular carcinoma: from molecular aspects to future therapeutic options.,,,10.1080/19336918.2023.2258539,exclude,"1. **Study Topic Assessment**: The title indicates this is about hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which is a type of liver cancer, not autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). The title suggests it's an ""overview,"" which typically indicates a review article rather than original research.

2. **Article Type**: The word ""Overview"" in the title strongly suggests this is a review article, editorial, or commentary rather than original research. According to exclusion criterion #2, review articles without original data should be excluded.

3. **Disease Focus**: The study focuses on hepatocellular carcinoma, not autoimmune hepatitis. While both are liver conditions, HCC is a malignancy and AIH is an autoimmune condition. There is no indication in the title that this paper addresses AIH or compares HCC to AIH.

4. **Checkpoint Receptors**: While the title mentions ""molecular aspects,"" there is no specific mention of any of the checkpoint receptors of interest (BTLA, CTLA-4, PD-1, TIGIT, VISTA, LAG-3, CD200R). The abstract is not available to confirm whether these molecules are discussed.

5. **Inclusion Criteria Assessment**:
   - Does not appear to be original research (likely a review)
   - No indication of examining the specified checkpoint receptors
   - Not about autoimmune hepatitis
   - No comparison to AIH patients or animal models

6. **Abstract Availability**: While the abstract is not available, the title alone provides sufficient information to determine that this paper is about HCC (not AIH) and appears to be a review article (not original research).",anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929,2026-01-28T09:37:58.513998
270,PD-1 immunobiology in autoimmune hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma.,,,10.1053/j.seminoncol.2017.12.001,include,"Let me evaluate this citation systematically against the protocol criteria:

**Title Analysis:**
- The title explicitly mentions ""PD-1 immunobiology in autoimmune hepatitis""
- PD-1 is one of the checkpoint receptors specifically listed in the inclusion criteria
- The title indicates the study involves autoimmune hepatitis (AIH)
- The title also mentions hepatocellular carcinoma, but AIH is clearly included

**Checking Inclusion Criteria:**
1. Original research articles - Cannot determine from title alone, but ""immunobiology"" suggests original research rather than a review
2. Studies examining PD-1 - YES, explicitly mentioned in title
3. Studies in AIH patients or models - YES, AIH is explicitly mentioned
4. Comparison groups - Cannot determine from title alone
5. Published in English - Cannot determine, but title is in English

**Checking Exclusion Criteria:**
1. Conference abstract - Cannot determine
2. Review article/editorial - The term ""immunobiology"" could suggest either original research or a review; unclear
3. Case report <3 patients - Unlikely given the scope implied by title
4. Exclusively on ICI-DILI - NO, this appears to be about AIH pathogenesis, not drug-induced injury
5. PBC/PSC without AIH - NO, AIH is explicitly mentioned

**Key Issue:**
The abstract is not available, making it impossible to definitively determine the study type or confirm it meets all inclusion criteria. However, the protocol instructions state: ""If the abstract is missing or insufficient to make a determination, lean towards INCLUDE to avoid missing potentially relevant studies (high sensitivity approach).""

Given that:
- The title directly addresses a checkpoint receptor (PD-1) in AIH
- This is exactly the topic of the systematic review
- There are no clear exclusion criteria met based on the title

**Assessing Inclusion Criteria:**

1. **Original research articles (human or animal studies)**: The title suggests this is an original research study on a murine (mouse) model, which qualifies as an animal study.

2. **Studies examining expression, function, or genetic variants of checkpoint receptors**: Yes - the study explicitly mentions PD-1, which is one of the checkpoint receptors listed in the protocol (PD-1, BTLA, CTLA-4, TIGIT, VISTA, LAG-3, CD200R).

3. **Studies in patients with AIH or animal models of AIH**: Yes - the title explicitly mentions ""murine autoimmune liver disease,"" which appears to be an animal model of autoimmune hepatitis.

4. **Studies comparing AIH to healthy controls or other liver disease controls**: Cannot determine from title alone, but this is not an absolute requirement for inclusion.

5. **Published in English**: The title is in English, suggesting the article is in English.

**Assessing Exclusion Criteria:**

1. **Conference abstracts without full text**: Cannot determine from the information provided, but no indication this is only an abstract.

2. **Review articles, editorials, commentaries, letters without original data**: The title suggests original research (describing a mechanism), not a review.

3. **Case reports with fewer than 3 patients**: Not applicable - this is an animal study.

4. **Studies exclusively on checkpoint inhibitor drug-induced liver injury (ICI-DILI)**: No indication this is about drug-induced liver injury; appears to be about the pathogenic mechanism of autoimmune liver disease.

5. **Studies on PBC or PSC without AIH comparison**: Not applicable - this is about autoimmune liver disease.

**Overall Assessment:**

The study appears to meet the key inclusion criteria: it's an original research study examining PD-1 (a checkpoint receptor of interest) in a murine model of autoimmune liver disease. The title suggests it investigates the functional role of PD-1+ CD8+ T cells in disease progression, which is directly relevant to understanding the pathogenesis of AIH. While the abstract is not available, the title provides sufficient information to suggest this is highly relevant to the review objectives.",anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929,2026-01-28T09:38:19.648048

**Available Information:**
- Title: ""PD-1/PD-L and autoimmunity: A growing relationship""

- No abstract available

**Assessment against Exclusion Criteria:**

1. **Conference abstract without full text**: Cannot determine from the information provided
2. **Review articles, editorials, commentaries, letters without original data**: The title suggests this could be a review article (""A growing relationship"" is a common phrasing for review articles discussing emerging topics). However, without an abstract or full text, I cannot confirm this definitively.
3. **Case reports with fewer than 3 patients**: Unlikely based on title
4. **Studies exclusively on checkpoint inhibitor drug-induced liver injury**: Not indicated by title
5. **Studies on PBC or PSC without AIH comparison**: Not indicated by title

**Assessment against Inclusion Criteria:**

1. **Original research articles**: Cannot confirm - title suggests possible review
2. **Studies examining PD-1**: Yes, the title mentions PD-1/PD-L
3. **Studies in AIH patients or models**: The title mentions ""autoimmunity"" broadly, but does NOT specifically mention autoimmune hepatitis or liver disease
4. **Comparison to controls**: Cannot determine
5. **Published in English**: Cannot determine, but title is in English

**Key Concerns:**
- The title suggests a broad discussion of PD-1/PD-L in autoimmunity generally, not specifically AIH
- No abstract is available to determine if AIH is even discussed
- The title phrasing suggests this may be a review article rather than original research

**Decision Approach:**
While the instruction suggests leaning toward INCLUDE when information is insufficient, this citation has significant red flags: (1) likely a review article based on title phrasing, and (2) appears to be about autoimmunity broadly rather than AIH specifically. Without any indication that AIH is covered, including this would likely result in screening an irrelevant article.",anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929,2026-01-28T09:40:20.473833

**Available Information:**
- Title indicates the study is about PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint therapy in patients with autoimmune and cholestatic liver disease
- No abstract is available
- No author, year, or journal information provided

**Evaluation against Inclusion Criteria:**
1. Original research articles - The title suggests this could be an original study examining therapy outcomes, but cannot confirm without abstract
2. Studies examining PD-1 (one of the target checkpoint receptors) - YES, PD-1/PD-L1 is explicitly mentioned
3. Studies in patients with autoimmune hepatitis - The title mentions ""autoimmune liver disease"" which likely includes AIH, though not explicitly stated
4. Studies comparing AIH to controls - Cannot determine from title alone
5. Published in English - Title is in English, likely yes

**Evaluation against Exclusion Criteria:**
1. Conference abstract without full text - Cannot determine
2. Review articles, editorials, etc. - The title suggests original data on therapy outcomes, but cannot confirm
3. Case reports <3 patients - Cannot determine, but ""patients"" (plural) suggests more than one
4. Studies exclusively on checkpoint inhibitor drug-induced liver injury - This is a critical consideration. The title mentions ""checkpoint therapy"" which could mean this is about ICI-DILI (drug-induced liver injury from checkpoint inhibitors), which would be an exclusion criterion
5. Studies on PBC/PSC without AIH - Title mentions ""cholestatic liver disease"" which could include PBC/PSC, but also mentions ""autoimmune"" liver disease

**Key Concern:**
The major ambiguity is whether this study is about:
- Checkpoint inhibitor-induced liver injury in patients who happen to have autoimmune liver disease (EXCLUDE)
- OR the expression/role of PD-1/PD-L1 in the pathogenesis of autoimmune liver disease (INCLUDE)

The phrase ""immune checkpoint therapy demonstrates favorable safety profile"" strongly suggests this is about treatment WITH checkpoint inhibitors (immunotherapy drugs), not about the endogenous checkpoint receptors in disease pathogenesis.

**Decision Rationale:**
Given the protocol instruction to ""lean towards INCLUDE to avoid missing potentially relevant studies"" when information is insufficient, and the fact that the abstract is completely unavailable, I should err on the side of inclusion for full-text review.",anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929,2026-01-28T09:40:33.077607

**Assessing Inclusion Criteria:**

1. **Original research article**: The title suggests this is an original research study examining PD-L1 expression and function, so this criterion appears to be met.

2. **Studies examining checkpoint receptors/ligands**: Yes - PD-L1 is the ligand for PD-1, which is explicitly listed in the inclusion criteria as one of the checkpoint receptors of interest.

3. **Studies in AIH patients or animal models**: This is UNCLEAR from the title alone. The study examines hepatocytes and viral infection, but there is no mention of autoimmune hepatitis specifically.

4. **Comparison to controls**: Cannot determine from title alone.

5. **Published in English**: Cannot determine, but title is in English.

**Assessing Exclusion Criteria:**

1. **Conference abstract**: Cannot determine from the information provided.

2. **Review article/editorial**: The title suggests original research (describing what ""is induced"" and what ""mediates""), so likely not a review.

3. **Case report <3 patients**: Does not appear to be a case report based on the title.

4. **Exclusively on ICI-DILI**: No - this appears to be about viral infection-induced PD-L1 expression, not checkpoint inhibitor drug-induced liver injury.

5. **PBC/PSC without AIH**: Not applicable based on title.

**Key Issue**: The major concern is that the title mentions ""viral infection"" as the context for PD-L1 induction in hepatocytes, with no mention of autoimmune hepatitis. This study may be focused on viral hepatitis rather than AIH.

However, given that:
- The abstract is not available for review
- The study examines PD-L1 (a relevant checkpoint ligand) in hepatocytes
- The instruction is to lean towards INCLUDE when information is insufficient to avoid missing potentially relevant studies

2. **Disease Relevance**:
   - Psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis are autoimmune conditions affecting the skin and joints
   - These are NOT autoimmune hepatitis or liver diseases
   - The review protocol specifically requires studies in AIH patients or animal models of AIH

3. **Study Type**: The title indicates this is a ""review,"" which would typically fall under exclusion criteria #2 (review articles without original data)

4. **Checkpoint Receptor Coverage**: While the study does examine PD-1/PD-L1, which is one of the checkpoint receptors of interest (PD-1 is listed in the inclusion criteria), the disease context is completely different from what the review protocol requires

5. **Inclusion Criteria Assessment**:
   - Criterion #3 requires studies in AIH patients or animal models of AIH - NOT MET
   - The study is about psoriasis/psoriatic arthritis, not AIH

6. **Exclusion Criteria Assessment**:
   - Criterion #2: This appears to be a review article - MEETS EXCLUSION

2. **Subject Matter**: The study focuses on ""ipilimumab-related hepatitis."" Ipilimumab is a checkpoint inhibitor drug (anti-CTLA-4 antibody) used in cancer treatment.

3. **Relevance to Checkpoint Receptors**: While the study does involve CTLA-4 (one of the checkpoint receptors in the inclusion criteria), it specifically examines hepatitis caused by ipilimumab treatment.

4. **Application of Exclusion Criteria**:
   - Exclusion criterion #4 specifically states: ""Studies exclusively on checkpoint inhibitor drug-induced liver injury (ICI-DILI)""
   - Ipilimumab-related hepatitis is a form of checkpoint inhibitor drug-induced liver injury (ICI-DILI)

The format ""Why You Need a Liver Biopsy"" suggests this may be an educational case presentation rather than original research.

2. **Topic Relevance**:
   - Pembrolizumab is a checkpoint inhibitor (anti-PD-1 therapy)
   - The study focuses on sclerosing cholangitis induced by checkpoint inhibitor therapy
   - This appears to be about checkpoint inhibitor drug-induced liver injury (ICI-DILI)

3. **Exclusion Criteria Application**:
   - **Exclusion Criterion #4**: ""Studies exclusively on checkpoint inhibitor drug-induced liver injury (ICI-DILI)"" - This study appears to be specifically about pembrolizumab (a checkpoint inhibitor drug) causing sclerosing cholangitis, which would be classified as ICI-DILI
   - **Exclusion Criterion #2**: The title format suggests this may be a case report, editorial, or educational commentary rather than original research
   - **Exclusion Criterion #3**: If this is a case report, it's unclear if it includes 3 or more patients

4. **Disease Focus**: The study is about sclerosing cholangitis (a biliary disease), not autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), which is the target condition for this review.

**Assessing Inclusion Criteria:**

1. **Original research articles**: The title suggests this is an original research article (uses language like ""possible involvement"" suggesting investigation of a hypothesis). No indication it's a review or other excluded type.

2. **Studies examining checkpoint receptors**: YES - The title explicitly mentions ""programmed cell death-1(+)"" which is PD-1, one of the checkpoint receptors specified in the protocol (BTLA, CTLA-4, PD-1, TIGIT, VISTA, LAG-3, CD200R).

3. **Studies in AIH patients or animal models**: YES - The title explicitly states ""autoimmune hepatitis"" as the condition being studied.

4. **Comparison to controls**: UNCERTAIN - Cannot determine from title alone whether controls were included.

5. **Published in English**: The title is in English, suggesting the article is in English.

**Assessing Exclusion Criteria:**

1. **Conference abstract without full text**: UNCERTAIN - No information provided about publication type.

2. **Review articles, editorials, etc.**: The title's phrasing (""possible involvement...in the pathogenesis"") suggests original research rather than a review.

3. **Case reports <3 patients**: Unlikely given the research question appears to be about a cell subset's role in pathogenesis.

4. **Exclusively on ICI-DILI**: NO - The title discusses pathogenesis of AIH itself, not drug-induced liver injury.

**Available Information:**
- Title: ""Postvaccination immune-mediated hepatitis: what do we really know?""
- No authors, year, journal, or abstract provided

**Analysis:**

1. **Type of publication:** The title phrase ""what do we really know?"" is commonly used in review articles, editorials, or commentary pieces rather than original research articles. This suggests it may fall under exclusion criterion #2 (review articles, editorials, commentaries).

2. **Topic relevance:** The title mentions ""immune-mediated hepatitis"" but specifically in the context of ""postvaccination."" This appears to be about vaccine-induced hepatitis rather than autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) as a primary disease entity.

3. **Checkpoint receptors:** There is no indication in the title that this study examines any of the specific checkpoint receptors listed (BTLA, CTLA-4, PD-1, TIGIT, VISTA, LAG-3, CD200R).

4. **Study population:** ""Postvaccination immune-mediated hepatitis"" suggests a focus on vaccine-related adverse events rather than classic AIH pathogenesis.

5. **Insufficient information:** With no abstract available, I cannot confirm whether this contains original data on checkpoint receptors in AIH patients.

**Key concerns:**
- The title suggests this is likely a review/commentary rather than original research
- The focus appears to be on vaccine-induced hepatitis, not autoimmune hepatitis
- No indication of checkpoint receptor involvement
- Completely missing abstract prevents verification

1. **Title Analysis**: The title mentions ""immune checkpoint inhibitor hepatitis"" which refers to drug-induced liver injury from checkpoint inhibitor medications (ICI-DILI), not autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) as a primary autoimmune disease.

2. **Checking Exclusion Criteria**:
   - Exclusion criterion #4 specifically states: ""Studies exclusively on checkpoint inhibitor drug-induced liver injury (ICI-DILI)""
   - The title clearly indicates this is about ""immune checkpoint inhibitor hepatitis"" which is ICI-DILI
   - The focus appears to be on reactivation of this drug-induced condition in the context of radiotherapy

3. **Checking Inclusion Criteria**:
   - The study does not appear to be about autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) as defined in the review protocol
   - While it involves checkpoint inhibitors, it's in the context of adverse drug reactions, not the pathogenesis of AIH
   - No indication this involves patients with AIH or animal models of AIH

4. **Abstract Availability**: The abstract is not available, which would normally warrant a more cautious approach. However, the title is quite clear and specific about the topic being ICI-DILI (checkpoint inhibitor hepatitis), not AIH.

2. **Checkpoint Receptor Relevance**: The study focuses on CTLA-4 (CTLA4), which is explicitly listed as one of the checkpoint receptors of interest in the inclusion criteria (#2).

3. **Disease Focus - Critical Issue**: The title mentions ""autosomal dominant immune dysregulation"" but does NOT specifically mention autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). The study appears to be about a broader immune dysregulation syndrome associated with CTLA4 variants.

4. **Abstract Limitation**: No abstract is available to determine:
   - Whether AIH patients were included in the study
   - Whether this is about general immune dysregulation vs. specific autoimmune conditions
   - What diseases/conditions were actually studied

5. **Inclusion Criterion #3 Assessment**: The protocol requires ""Studies in patients with autoimmune hepatitis or animal models of AIH."" Without an abstract, I cannot confirm this study includes AIH patients.

6. **High Sensitivity Approach**: The instructions state that when abstract is missing or insufficient, I should lean towards INCLUDE to avoid missing potentially relevant studies. CTLA4 variants can be associated with multiple autoimmune conditions including AIH, and this study examining CTLA4 variation in immune dysregulation could potentially include AIH patients.

7. **Risk Assessment**: Excluding this could mean missing a relevant study if AIH was among the conditions studied. Including it for full-text review would allow proper assessment.",anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929,2026-01-28T10:35:10.157587

**Analyzing the Title:**
- The study examines ""Programmed cell death-1 rs11568821"" - PD-1 is one of the checkpoint receptors explicitly listed in the inclusion criteria (PD-1)
- It examines genetic polymorphisms (rs11568821) of PD-1, which falls under ""genetic variants"" mentioned in inclusion criterion #2
- The study is specifically about ""autoimmune hepatitis"" - directly matches inclusion criterion #3
- Also examines interleukin-28B polymorphisms, which while not a checkpoint receptor, doesn't disqualify the study since it includes PD-1

**Checking Inclusion Criteria:**
1. Original research articles - The title suggests this is an original research study examining genetic polymorphisms (likely yes)
2. Studies examining genetic variants of PD-1 - YES, explicitly mentions PD-1 rs11568821 polymorphism
3. Studies in patients with AIH - YES, explicitly mentions autoimmune hepatitis

3. **Case reports with fewer than 3 patients**: This is an animal study, not a case report.
4. **Studies exclusively on checkpoint inhibitor drug-induced liver injury**: Not applicable based on title.
5. **Studies on PBC or PSC without AIH comparison**: Not applicable; this is specifically about AIH.

**Critical Issue:**
The main concern is that the title does not mention any of the specific checkpoint receptors listed in the inclusion criteria. However, the abstract is not available, and it's possible that checkpoint receptors are examined in the study but not highlighted in the title. The study is clearly about AIH pathogenesis in an animal model, which is relevant to the review's broader objective.

Given the instruction to ""lean towards INCLUDE to avoid missing potentially relevant studies (high sensitivity approach)"" when information is insufficient, and considering that this is an AIH animal model study that could potentially discuss checkpoint receptors in the full text, I should err on the side of inclusion.",anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929,2026-01-28T10:35:32.502407
162,Putative Abscopal Effect in Three Patients Treated by Combined Radiotherapy and Modulated Electrohyperthermia.,,,10.3389/fonc.2020.00254,exclude,"1. **Review the citation content**: The title indicates this is a study about three patients treated with combined radiotherapy and modulated electrohyperthermia, focusing on a ""putative abscopal effect."" The abscopal effect refers to a phenomenon in cancer treatment where localized treatment causes systemic effects at distant sites.

2. **Check against inclusion criteria**:
   - The study appears to be about cancer treatment (radiotherapy and electrohyperthermia), not autoimmune hepatitis
   - No mention of checkpoint receptors (BTLA, CTLA-4, PD-1, TIGIT, VISTA, LAG-3, CD200R) in the title
   - No mention of autoimmune hepatitis or liver disease
   - No mention of immune checkpoint pathways relevant to AIH pathogenesis

3. **Check against exclusion criteria**:
   - This appears to be a case report with only 3 patients (meets exclusion criterion #3: ""Case reports with fewer than 3 patients"" - though technically 3 patients is borderline)
   - More importantly, the topic is completely unrelated to autoimmune hepatitis - it's about cancer radiotherapy treatment

4. **Consider the missing abstract**: While the protocol suggests leaning toward INCLUDE when information is insufficient, the title alone provides clear evidence that this study is about cancer treatment with radiotherapy and electrohyperthermia, which is entirely outside the scope of a systematic review on checkpoint receptors in autoimmune hepatitis.

5. **Final assessment**: This citation is clearly not relevant to the review objectives. It does not address AIH, checkpoint receptors in the context of autoimmune disease, or any related topic.",anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929,2026-01-28T10:35:41.415921
146,Rapid Progression of Liver Fibrosis Induced by Acute Liver Injury Due to Immune-related Adverse Events of Atezolizumab.,,,10.2169/internalmedicine.6535-20,exclude,"1. **Study Type Assessment**: The title suggests this is a study about a clinical case or cases involving atezolizumab-induced liver injury. Without an abstract or additional information, it's difficult to determine if this is original research, a case report, or another type of publication.

2. **Topic Relevance**: The study focuses on ""immune-related adverse events"" (irAEs) from atezolizumab, which is a checkpoint inhibitor (anti-PD-L1 antibody). This appears to be about checkpoint inhibitor drug-induced liver injury (ICI-DILI).

3. **Exclusion Criteria Application**:
   - Exclusion criterion #4 specifically states: ""Studies exclusively on checkpoint inhibitor drug-induced liver injury (ICI-DILI)"" should be excluded
   - The title clearly indicates this is about liver injury caused by atezolizumab (a checkpoint inhibitor drug), which falls under ICI-DILI

4. **Inclusion Criteria Assessment**:
   - The study does not appear to be about autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) as a primary disease
   - It's about drug-induced liver injury from checkpoint inhibitor therapy
   - While checkpoint receptors are involved mechanistically, this is about adverse effects of checkpoint inhibitor drugs, not the pathogenesis of AIH

5. **Key Distinction**: The review is interested in checkpoint receptors in the pathogenesis of AIH, not in liver injury caused by checkpoint inhibitor drugs used for cancer treatment.",anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929,2026-01-28T10:35:49.959043

**Assessing Inclusion Criteria:**

1. **Original research articles**: The title suggests this is an original research article studying T-cell function, not a review or commentary.

2. **Studies examining checkpoint receptors/ligands**: The title mentions ""Regulatory T-cell conditioning"" and ""suppressor function."" Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are closely associated with checkpoint receptors, particularly CTLA-4 and PD-1, which are critical for their suppressive function. However, the title does not explicitly mention any of the specific checkpoint receptors listed (BTLA, CTLA-4, PD-1, TIGIT, VISTA, LAG-3, CD200R).

3. **Studies in AIH patients or animal models**: Yes - the title explicitly mentions ""autoimmune hepatitis/autoimmune sclerosing cholangitis.""

4. **Comparison to controls**: Cannot determine from title alone.

5. **Published in English**: Cannot determine, but title is in English.

**Assessing Exclusion Criteria:**

1. **Conference abstract**: Cannot determine from the information provided.
2. **Review/editorial/commentary**: The title suggests original research on mechanisms.
3. **Case report <3 patients**: Unlikely given the mechanistic nature suggested by the title.
4. **ICI-DILI exclusively**: No - this is about autoimmune hepatitis pathogenesis, not drug-induced injury.
5. **PSC/PBC without AIH**: No - AIH is explicitly mentioned.

**Key Considerations:**

- The abstract is not available, making full assessment impossible
- The title suggests mechanistic research on Treg function in AIH
- While checkpoint receptors are not explicitly mentioned, Treg suppressor function is intimately linked to checkpoint pathways, particularly CTLA-4

1. **Publication type**: The title suggests this is likely a case report describing a single patient receiving anti-PD-1 immunotherapy who had pre-existing primary biliary cholangitis (PBC).

2. **Disease focus**: The study is about primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), not autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). According to exclusion criterion #5, studies on PBC without AIH comparison should be excluded.

3. **Study subject**: The focus appears to be on the safety of administering checkpoint inhibitor therapy (anti-PD-1) in a patient with pre-existing liver disease, rather than studying the role of checkpoint receptors in the pathogenesis of autoimmune hepatitis.

4. **Number of patients**: The title indicates ""a patient"" (singular), suggesting this is a single case report. According to exclusion criterion #3, case reports with fewer than 3 patients should be excluded.

5. **Checkpoint inhibitor drug-induced liver injury**: This appears to be about administering checkpoint inhibitor drugs to a patient with pre-existing liver disease, which relates to checkpoint inhibitor therapy rather than the pathogenic role of checkpoint receptors in AIH (exclusion criterion #4).

6. **No abstract available**: While the absence of an abstract normally would warrant a more cautious approach, the title provides sufficient information to determine that this study does not meet the inclusion criteria on multiple grounds.",anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929,2026-01-28T10:36:08.661921

2. **Topic Assessment**: The study is about ""Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor Hepatitis"" which refers to drug-induced liver injury caused by checkpoint inhibitor therapy (ICI-DILI), specifically triggered by Sotorasib (a KRAS G12C inhibitor used in cancer treatment).

3. **Application of Exclusion Criteria**:
   - **Exclusion Criterion #3**: ""Case reports with fewer than 3 patients"" - This is a single case report, which falls below the threshold of 3 patients required for inclusion.
   - **Exclusion Criterion #4**: ""Studies exclusively on checkpoint inhibitor drug-induced liver injury (ICI-DILI)"" - This study is specifically about hepatitis triggered by checkpoint inhibitor therapy in a cancer patient, not about autoimmune hepatitis as a primary autoimmune disease.

4. **Application of Inclusion Criteria**:
   - The study does not appear to involve autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) as defined in the protocol. Instead, it involves drug-induced hepatitis from cancer immunotherapy.
   - The study is in a cancer patient (NSCLC - non-small cell lung cancer), not in AIH patients or animal models of AIH.

5. **Relevance to Review Objective**: The review is focused on the role of checkpoint receptors in the pathogenesis of autoimmune hepatitis as a disease entity, not on adverse effects of checkpoint inhibitor drugs used in cancer treatment.",anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929,2026-01-28T10:36:16.884266

**Title Analysis:**
The title mentions ""anti-PD1 T-cell checkpoint inhibitor-induced hepatotoxicity"" which suggests this is about drug-induced liver injury from checkpoint inhibitor therapy.

**Checking Exclusion Criteria:**

1. Conference abstracts without full text - Cannot determine from the information provided
2. Review articles, editorials, commentaries, letters without original data - Cannot determine, but the title suggests it may be a case report or original study
3. Case reports with fewer than 3 patients - The title uses singular ""hepatotoxicity"" which may suggest a case report, but cannot confirm the number of patients
4. **Studies exclusively on checkpoint inhibitor drug-induced liver injury (ICI-DILI)** - This is the critical criterion. The title explicitly states this is about ""anti-PD1 T-cell checkpoint inhibitor-induced hepatotoxicity,"" which is checkpoint inhibitor drug-induced liver injury (ICI-DILI)
5. Studies on PBC or PSC without AIH comparison - Not applicable here

**Checking Inclusion Criteria:**
While the study does involve PD-1 (an inclusion criterion #2), it appears to be studying the adverse effects of anti-PD1 therapy (drug-induced liver injury) rather than studying the role of PD-1 in the pathogenesis of autoimmune hepatitis itself.

**Key Issue:**
Exclusion criterion #4 specifically excludes ""Studies exclusively on checkpoint inhibitor drug-induced liver injury (ICI-DILI)."" This study appears to be focused on hepatotoxicity caused by anti-PD1 checkpoint inhibitor drugs, which falls under ICI-DILI.

3. **Case report <3 patients**: This is a mouse study, not a case report. Not excluded ✓

4. **Exclusively on ICI-DILI**: No indication this is about checkpoint inhibitor drug-induced liver injury. Not excluded ✓

5. **PBC/PSC without AIH**: Study is specifically about AIH. Not excluded ✓

**Critical Issue**: The main problem is that this study appears to focus on TNF-α and CCL20, which are NOT among the checkpoint receptors specified in the inclusion criteria. The review is specifically about inhibitory checkpoint receptors and their ligands, and TNF-α/CCL20 do not fall into this category.

However, the abstract is not available, and it's possible that the study also examines checkpoint receptors in the context of TNF-α-mediated AIH pathogenesis.",anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929,2026-01-28T10:38:15.436239
207,Tfh and plasma cells are correlated with hypergammaglobulinaemia in patients with autoimmune hepatitis.,,,10.1111/liv.12245,exclude,"1. **Study Type Assessment**: The title suggests this is an original research article examining correlations between T follicular helper (Tfh) cells, plasma cells, and hypergammaglobulinemia in autoimmune hepatitis patients. This appears to be original research rather than a review, editorial, or commentary.

2. **Disease Relevance**: The study explicitly focuses on patients with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), which meets inclusion criterion #3.

3. **Checkpoint Receptor Relevance**: This is the critical assessment point. The title mentions:
   - Tfh cells (T follicular helper cells)
   - Plasma cells
   - Hypergammaglobulinemia

   However, the title does NOT explicitly mention any of the checkpoint receptors listed in the inclusion criteria (BTLA, CTLA-4, PD-1, TIGIT, VISTA, LAG-3, CD200R) or their ligands.

4. **Abstract Availability**: The abstract is not available, which limits the ability to determine if checkpoint receptors were examined in the study methodology or results, even if not mentioned in the title.

5. **Conservative Approach**: Given the systematic review screening instructions to ""lean towards INCLUDE to avoid missing potentially relevant studies (high sensitivity approach)"" when information is insufficient, and considering that:
   - Tfh cells can express checkpoint receptors like PD-1
   - The study is on AIH patients
   - The abstract is unavailable to confirm whether checkpoint receptors were measured

   A conservative, high-sensitivity approach would suggest inclusion for full-text review.

However, the title gives no indication whatsoever that checkpoint receptors are part of this study's focus, making it unlikely to meet inclusion criterion #2.",anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929,2026-01-28T10:38:27.154970
266,The Liver in Oncology.,,,10.1016/j.cld.2017.06.003,exclude,"1. **Title Analysis**: ""The Liver in Oncology"" suggests this is a general text about liver conditions in the context of cancer/oncology. This does not specifically indicate content about autoimmune hepatitis or checkpoint receptors in AIH.

2. **Abstract Availability**: No abstract is available, and no author, year, or journal information is provided. This makes it very difficult to assess the content.

3. **Likely Publication Type**: The title format ""The Liver in Oncology"" suggests this may be a book chapter, review article, or general textbook rather than an original research article. This would fall under exclusion criteria #2 (review articles, editorials, commentaries).

4. **Relevance to Research Question**:
   - The title does not mention autoimmune hepatitis
   - The title does not mention any checkpoint receptors (BTLA, CTLA-4, PD-1, TIGIT, VISTA, LAG-3, CD200R)
   - The oncology focus suggests it may be about cancer-related liver issues rather than autoimmune conditions
   - It could potentially discuss checkpoint inhibitor-induced liver injury (ICI-DILI), which is explicitly excluded (exclusion criteria #4)

5. **High Sensitivity Approach Consideration**: While the protocol suggests leaning towards INCLUDE when information is insufficient, the title itself provides strong evidence that this is not relevant to the research question. The title clearly indicates an oncology focus rather than autoimmune hepatitis, and there is no indication of original research on checkpoint receptors in AIH.",anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929,2026-01-28T10:38:36.006039

2. **Relevant Checkpoint Receptor**: The study examines CTLA-4 (Cytotoxic T lymphocyte associated antigen-4), which is explicitly listed as one of the checkpoint receptors of interest in the inclusion criteria (#2).

3. **Disease Condition**: The study specifically focuses on autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), which matches the inclusion criteria (#3).

4. **Type of Investigation**: The study examines gene polymorphisms (genetic variants) of CTLA-4, which aligns with the protocol's interest in ""genetic associations"" as stated in the objective.

5. **Exclusion Criteria Consideration**:
   - Exclusion criterion #2 states: ""Review articles, editorials, commentaries, letters without original data""
   - A meta-analysis is a type of review article that synthesizes existing studies
   - However, meta-analyses often involve original statistical analysis and data synthesis, which could be considered ""original data"" in terms of the pooled analysis

6. **Ambiguity**: There is tension between the study being highly relevant to the research question (CTLA-4 genetic variants in AIH) and it being a meta-analysis (typically excluded as a review article). The exclusion criterion specifically mentions ""without original data,"" and meta-analyses do generate original pooled statistical analyses.

7. **Abstract Availability**: No abstract is available to clarify whether this meta-analysis presents novel pooled data analysis or is purely descriptive.

Given the high relevance to the research question and the ambiguity about whether meta-analyses with original statistical analysis should be excluded, and following the instruction to lean towards INCLUDE when information is insufficient, I would include this for full-text review.",anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929,2026-01-28T10:38:46.497388

**Assessing Inclusion Criteria:**
1. Original research articles - The title suggests this is an original research article describing an animal model, likely presenting original data on inducing AIH in mice.
2. Studies examining checkpoint receptors - Cannot determine from title alone whether BTLA, CTLA-4, PD-1, TIGIT, VISTA, LAG-3, or CD200R are examined.
3. Studies in AIH patients or animal models - YES, clearly mentions ""autoimmune hepatitis mouse model"" specifically in HLA-DR4 NOD mice.
4. Studies comparing AIH to controls - Cannot determine from title alone.
5. Published in English - Appears to be in English based on the title.

**Assessing Exclusion Criteria:**
1. Conference abstracts without full text - Cannot determine publication type from the information provided.
2. Review articles, editorials, etc. - The title suggests original research on model development, not a review.
3. Case reports <3 patients - Not applicable (animal study).
4. Studies exclusively on ICI-DILI - NO, this is about an AIH mouse model, not drug-induced liver injury.
5. Studies on PBC/PSC without AIH - NO, this is specifically about AIH.

**Key Considerations:**
- The abstract is not available, making it impossible to determine if checkpoint receptors are studied
- The title clearly indicates this is about an AIH animal model (HLA-DR4 NOD mice)
- This appears to be describing methodology for inducing AIH in a specific mouse model
- Following the instruction to ""lean towards INCLUDE to avoid missing potentially relevant studies"" when information is insufficient

Since the study is clearly about an AIH animal model (meeting inclusion criterion #3) and the abstract is unavailable to determine whether checkpoint receptors are examined, a high sensitivity approach suggests inclusion for full-text review.",anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929,2026-01-28T10:38:56.279875

**Assessing Inclusion Criteria:**

1. **Original research article**: The title suggests this is an original research study describing a transgenic mouse model, which would qualify as original research.

2. **Studies examining checkpoint receptors**: The title does not mention any of the specific checkpoint receptors (BTLA, CTLA-4, PD-1, TIGIT, VISTA, LAG-3, or CD200R). The focus appears to be on IL-12 (interleukin-12), which is not one of the target molecules.

3. **Studies in AIH patients or animal models**: The title explicitly states this is a mouse model that ""mimics human autoimmune hepatitis,"" which qualifies as an animal model of AIH.

4. **Comparison to controls**: Cannot determine from title alone.

5. **Published in English**: Title is in English, suggesting the article is in English.

**Assessing Exclusion Criteria:**

1. **Conference abstract**: Cannot determine from the information provided.
2. **Review article/editorial**: The title suggests original research, not a review.
3. **Case report <3 patients**: This is an animal study, not a case report.
4. **ICI-DILI exclusively**: Not applicable - this is about IL-12, not checkpoint inhibitor drugs.
5. **PBC/PSC without AIH**: Not applicable - focuses on AIH model.

**Key Issue:**
The main concern is that the title focuses on IL-12 and does not mention any of the specific checkpoint receptors of interest. However, the abstract is not available, and it's possible that the study examines checkpoint receptors as part of characterizing this AIH model. Since the instruction is to lean towards INCLUDE when information is insufficient (high sensitivity approach), and this is clearly an AIH animal model study, there is a possibility that checkpoint receptors were examined in the full paper.",anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929,2026-01-28T10:39:07.063397
267,Tregopathy in focus.,,,10.3389/fimmu.2025.1658140,exclude,"1. **Article Type Assessment**: The title ""Tregopathy in focus"" suggests this could be a review article, commentary, or editorial rather than an original research article. The word ""in focus"" is commonly used in review-type publications or perspective pieces.

2. **Abstract Availability**: No abstract is available, and no author, year, or journal information is provided. This makes it impossible to determine:
   - Whether it contains original data
   - Whether it examines any of the specified checkpoint receptors (BTLA, CTLA-4, PD-1, TIGIT, VISTA, LAG-3, CD200R)
   - Whether it relates to autoimmune hepatitis

3. **Title Analysis**: ""Tregopathy"" refers to regulatory T cell dysfunction/pathology. While regulatory T cells are related to immune checkpoint pathways (particularly CTLA-4 and potentially other checkpoint molecules), the title alone does not indicate:
   - A focus on AIH specifically
   - Investigation of the specific checkpoint receptors listed in the inclusion criteria
   - That it contains original research data

4. **Exclusion Criteria Check**: Based on the title format and phrasing, this appears likely to be a review article, editorial, or commentary (Exclusion Criterion #2), but this cannot be confirmed without more information.

5. **High Sensitivity Approach**: Given the instruction to lean towards INCLUDE when information is insufficient, and considering that regulatory T cells are mechanistically linked to checkpoint receptors like CTLA-4, there is a possibility this could contain relevant original data.

However, the complete lack of abstract, author information, and the title's format strongly suggest this is not an original research article, which is a fundamental inclusion criterion.",anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929,2026-01-28T10:39:17.008592

**Analyzing the title:**
- The title mentions ""Type 2 autoimmune hepatitis murine model""
- This indicates it is an animal study of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH)
- The study appears to focus on genetic background's influence on disease development

**Checking Inclusion Criteria:**
1. Original research articles (human or animal studies) - The title suggests this is an original research article using a murine (mouse) model ✓
2. Studies examining expression, function, or genetic variants of checkpoint receptors - UNCERTAIN from title alone; the study focuses on genetic background but doesn't explicitly mention checkpoint receptors
3. Studies in patients with AIH or animal models of AIH - Yes, explicitly mentions ""autoimmune hepatitis murine model"" ✓
4. Studies comparing AIH to healthy controls or other disease controls - Cannot determine from title alone
5. Published in English - Cannot determine, but title is in English

**Checking Exclusion Criteria:**
1. Conference abstracts without full text - Cannot determine publication type from available information

4. Studies exclusively on checkpoint inhibitor drug-induced liver injury - No indication of this
5. Studies on PBC or PSC without AIH - This is specifically about AIH ✓

**Key considerations:**
- The abstract is not available, making it difficult to determine if checkpoint receptors are studied

153,Unchecked immunity: a unique case of sequential immune-related adverse events with Pembrolizumab.,,,10.1186/s40425-019-0727-5,exclude,"1. **Article Type Assessment**: The title suggests this is a case report (""a unique case"") describing immune-related adverse events (irAEs) with Pembrolizumab, which is a checkpoint inhibitor drug.

2. **Subject Matter**: The study appears to focus on immune-related adverse events caused by Pembrolizumab (an anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor drug), which would fall under checkpoint inhibitor drug-induced liver injury (ICI-DILI) if liver involvement is present.

3. **Exclusion Criteria Application**:
   - **Exclusion Criterion #3**: ""Case reports with fewer than 3 patients"" - The title explicitly states ""a unique case"" (singular), suggesting this is a single case report, which would have fewer than 3 patients.
   - **Exclusion Criterion #4**: ""Studies exclusively on checkpoint inhibitor drug-induced liver injury (ICI-DILI)"" - This appears to be about drug-induced immune-related adverse events from Pembrolizumab, not about the pathogenesis of autoimmune hepatitis itself.

4. **Inclusion Criteria Assessment**:
   - The study does not appear to examine checkpoint receptors in the context of autoimmune hepatitis pathogenesis
   - It appears to be about adverse events from checkpoint inhibitor therapy, which is a different clinical scenario

5. **Missing Information**: While the abstract is not available, the title provides sufficient information to determine that this is likely a single case report about drug-induced immune-related adverse events, not a study of checkpoint receptors in AIH pathogenesis.",anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929,2026-01-28T10:39:34.178449
281,Under-Evaluated or Unassessed Pathogenic Pathways in Autoimmune Hepatitis and Implications for Future Management.,,,10.1007/s10620-018-5072-x,include,"1. **Article Type Assessment**: The title suggests this could be a review article (""Implications for Future Management"" is common in review titles), but without an abstract or full text, I cannot definitively determine if this contains original data or is purely a review/commentary.

2. **Topic Relevance**: The title directly mentions ""Autoimmune Hepatitis"" and ""Pathogenic Pathways,"" which is relevant to the review's focus on AIH pathogenesis.

3. **Checkpoint Receptor Relevance**: The title mentions ""Under-Evaluated or Unassessed Pathogenic Pathways."" Inhibitory checkpoint receptors could potentially fall under ""under-evaluated pathways"" in AIH, but this is speculative without the abstract or full text.

4. **Missing Critical Information**:
   - No abstract is available
   - No author information
   - No journal information
   - No year of publication
   - Cannot determine if it's original research or a review
   - Cannot determine if it discusses any of the specific checkpoint receptors of interest

5. **Application of Protocol Guidance**: The instructions state ""If the abstract is missing or insufficient to make a determination, lean towards INCLUDE to avoid missing potentially relevant studies (high sensitivity approach).""

6. **Risk Assessment**:
   - Risk of false exclusion: HIGH - The article is about AIH pathogenesis and could discuss checkpoint receptors
   - Risk of false inclusion: LOW - Can be screened out at full-text review if irrelevant

Given the high sensitivity approach recommended and the direct relevance to AIH, despite the lack of information about specific checkpoint receptors, I should err on the side of inclusion.",anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929,2026-01-28T10:39:43.411318
271,Unmet needs in autoimmune liver diseases.,,,10.1016/j.coi.2025.102565,exclude,"1. **Article Type Assessment**: The title ""Unmet needs in autoimmune liver diseases"" suggests this is likely a review article, commentary, or editorial discussing gaps in knowledge or clinical practice rather than presenting original research data.

2. **Abstract Availability**: No abstract is provided, which limits the ability to determine if original data is presented. However, the title structure (""Unmet needs in..."") is characteristic of review/perspective pieces rather than original research articles.

3. **Comparison with Inclusion Criteria**:
   - Criterion 1 requires ""original research articles"" - the title suggests this is NOT original research
   - Cannot determine from title alone if it examines the specific checkpoint receptors listed
   - Cannot determine if it focuses specifically on AIH or broader autoimmune liver diseases

4. **Comparison with Exclusion Criteria**:
   - Criterion 2 excludes ""review articles, editorials, commentaries, letters without original data"" - the title strongly suggests this falls into this category
   - The phrase ""unmet needs"" is typically used in review/perspective articles that synthesize existing knowledge rather than present new data

5. **High Sensitivity Consideration**: While the instruction suggests leaning toward INCLUDE when information is insufficient, the title itself provides strong evidence that this is a review/commentary type article, which is explicitly excluded by the protocol.

6. **Final Assessment**: Despite limited information, the title format is highly characteristic of excluded article types (reviews, commentaries, perspectives on clinical gaps).",anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929,2026-01-28T10:59:57.383226
312,"Updates in the pathogenesis and management of immune-related enterocolitis, hepatitis and cardiovascular toxicities.",,,10.1016/j.iotech.2024.100704,exclude,"1. **Document Type Assessment**: The title suggests this is likely a review article focused on ""Updates in the pathogenesis and management"" which typically indicates a review rather than original research. The use of ""Updates"" further suggests a summary of existing knowledge rather than presentation of new original data.

2. **Topic Relevance**: The article mentions ""hepatitis"" but in the context of ""immune-related"" toxicities alongside enterocolitis and cardiovascular toxicities. This phrasing strongly suggests the article is about immune checkpoint inhibitor-related adverse events (ICI-DILI and other immune-related adverse events), not autoimmune hepatitis as a primary disease entity.

3. **Exclusion Criteria Application**:
   - Exclusion criterion #2: ""Review articles, editorials, commentaries, letters without original data"" - The title structure (""Updates in..."") strongly suggests this is a review article.
   - Exclusion criterion #4: ""Studies exclusively on checkpoint inhibitor drug-induced liver injury (ICI-DILI)"" - The term ""immune-related hepatitis"" in the context of toxicities strongly indicates this is about drug-induced liver injury from checkpoint inhibitor therapy, not autoimmune hepatitis.

4. **Abstract Availability**: No abstract is available, which creates uncertainty. However, the title alone provides strong indicators about the nature and focus of the article.

5. **High Sensitivity Consideration**: While the instruction suggests leaning toward INCLUDE when uncertain, the title provides sufficient information to reasonably conclude this is both (a) a review article and (b) focused on checkpoint inhibitor-induced toxicities rather than autoimmune hepatitis.",anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929,2026-01-28T11:00:06.035333

**Title Analysis:**
The title mentions ""immune-related hepatitis"" which could potentially refer to autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), but the term ""immune-related hepatitis"" is more commonly used in the context of checkpoint inhibitor drug-induced liver injury (ICI-DILI). The mention of ""steroid-refractory"" treatment and therapeutic agents (ursodeoxycholic acid and bezafibrate) suggests this is a clinical case.

**Publication Type:**
The title explicitly states ""a case report,"" which triggers evaluation against exclusion criterion #3 (case reports with fewer than 3 patients). A single case report would typically involve only one patient, which would fall below the threshold of 3 patients.

**Checkpoint Inhibitor Context:**
The term ""immune-related hepatitis"" is strongly suggestive of checkpoint inhibitor-induced liver injury (ICI-DILI), which is explicitly excluded by criterion #4. This terminology is standard nomenclature for adverse events related to cancer immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors.

**Abstract Availability:**
No abstract is available, which limits the ability to confirm whether this involves AIH or ICI-DILI, or whether it includes any investigation of checkpoint receptors (BTLA, CTLA-4, PD-1, TIGIT, VISTA, LAG-3, CD200R).

**Key Concerns:**
1. This appears to be a single case report (< 3 patients) - Exclusion criterion #3
2. ""Immune-related hepatitis"" strongly suggests ICI-DILI - Exclusion criterion #4
3. No indication that checkpoint receptors or their ligands are studied
4. Focus appears to be on treatment rather than pathogenesis or expression of checkpoint molecules",anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929,2026-01-28T11:00:15.534045

**Assessing Inclusion Criteria:**

1. **Original research article**: The title suggests this is an original research study examining ""usefulness"" and ""frequencies"" of specific cell subsets, which implies original data collection and analysis.

2. **Studies examining checkpoint receptors**: Yes - the study explicitly mentions ""programmed cell death-1(+)"" which is PD-1, one of the checkpoint receptors specified in the protocol (BTLA, CTLA-4, PD-1, TIGIT, VISTA, LAG-3, CD200R).

3. **Studies in AIH patients or animal models**: Yes - the title explicitly mentions ""autoimmune hepatitis"" as the disease being studied.

4. **Comparison to controls**: The title mentions ""diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis,"" which typically implies comparison to other conditions or controls to establish diagnostic utility.

5. **Published in English**: The title is in English, suggesting the article is in English.

**Assessing Exclusion Criteria:**

1. **Conference abstract**: Cannot determine from the information provided
2. **Review article/editorial**: The title structure suggests original research, not a review
3. **Case report <3 patients**: Unlikely given the focus on ""frequencies"" which suggests a larger cohort
4. **Exclusively on ICI-DILI**: No indication of this; appears to be about AIH itself
5. **PBC/PSC without AIH**: The study is specifically about AIH

**Key Considerations:**
- The abstract is not available, which limits full assessment
- However, the title clearly indicates the study examines PD-1 expression on follicular helper T cells in the context of AIH diagnosis
- This directly aligns with the review's objective to examine checkpoint receptors in AIH pathogenesis

**Available Information:**
- Title: ""Usefulness of liver infiltrating CD86-positive mononuclear cells for diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis""
- No abstract available
- No author, year, or journal information provided

**Evaluation against Inclusion Criteria:**

1. **Original research articles**: The title suggests this is likely an original research study (uses ""usefulness"" suggesting empirical investigation), but cannot be confirmed without abstract.

2. **Studies examining expression, function, or genetic variants of checkpoint receptors**: CD86 is mentioned in the title. CD86 (B7-2) is a co-stimulatory molecule that is the ligand for CTLA-4 (one of the checkpoint receptors in the inclusion criteria). This makes it relevant to the review's scope.

3. **Studies in patients with AIH or animal models**: The title explicitly mentions ""autoimmune hepatitis,"" so this criterion appears to be met.

4. **Studies comparing AIH to healthy controls or other liver disease controls**: Cannot determine from title alone, but the diagnostic focus suggests comparison groups may be involved.

5. **Published in English**: Cannot confirm, but title is in English.

**Evaluation against Exclusion Criteria:**

1. **Conference abstracts without full text**: Cannot determine publication type from available information.
2. **Review articles, editorials, etc.**: The title suggests original research rather than a review.
3. **Case reports with <3 patients**: Unlikely given the diagnostic utility focus, but cannot confirm.
4. **Studies exclusively on ICI-DILI**: No indication of this.
5. **Studies on PBC/PSC without AIH**: The title specifically mentions AIH.

**Key Consideration:**
CD86 is the ligand for CTLA-4, which is explicitly listed in the inclusion criteria. Studies examining checkpoint receptor ligands are relevant to understanding the checkpoint receptor pathway in AIH pathogenesis.

Given the instruction to lean towards INCLUDE when information is insufficient (high sensitivity approach), and given that CD86 is directly relevant as a CTLA-4 ligand and the study is clearly about AIH, this citation should be included for full-text review.",anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929,2026-01-28T11:00:38.206068
200,Validating a novel algorithm to identify patients with autoimmune hepatitis in an administrative database.,,,10.1002/pds.5291,exclude,"1. **Study Type Assessment**: The title suggests this is a methodological study focused on validating an algorithm to identify AIH patients in an administrative database. This appears to be a methods/validation study rather than a study examining the biological mechanisms, expression patterns, or genetic associations of checkpoint receptors.

2. **Relevance to Research Question**: The review protocol specifically seeks studies examining:
   - Expression patterns of checkpoint receptors (BTLA, CTLA-4, PD-1, TIGIT, VISTA, LAG-3, CD200R)
   - Functional roles of these receptors
   - Genetic associations
   - Potential as therapeutic targets

   A study validating a database algorithm for identifying AIH patients does not appear to address any of these objectives. This seems to be a study about case identification methodology rather than the pathogenesis or immunological mechanisms of AIH.

   - May be original research (unclear without abstract)
   - Does NOT appear to examine checkpoint receptors or their ligands
   - Involves AIH patients but focuses on identification methodology

   - Not clearly a review, editorial, or commentary based on title
   - Not a case report
   - Not about ICI-DILI

The title format ""How Long Should We Watch?"" suggests a clinical observation/case discussion rather than original research on checkpoint receptor pathogenesis.

2. **Subject Matter**: The study is about pembrolizumab (an anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor drug) causing hepatitis as an adverse effect. This is checkpoint inhibitor drug-induced liver injury (ICI-DILI).

3. **Relevance to Inclusion Criteria**:
   - The study involves PD-1 (pembrolizumab targets PD-1), which is one of the checkpoint receptors of interest
   - However, this appears to be about drug-induced liver injury from checkpoint inhibitor therapy, not about autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) pathogenesis
   - The study is about adverse effects of cancer immunotherapy, not about the role of checkpoint receptors in AIH

4. **Exclusion Criteria Application**:
   - **Exclusion criterion #4** specifically states: ""Studies exclusively on checkpoint inhibitor drug-induced liver injury (ICI-DILI)"" should be excluded
   - This study appears to be exclusively about pembrolizumab-induced hepatitis (ICI-DILI)

157,Workup and Management of Immune-Mediated Hepatobiliary Pancreatic Toxicities That Develop During Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor Treatment.,,,10.1634/theoncologist.2018-0162,exclude,"1. **Document Type Assessment**: The title suggests this is likely a clinical guidance or review article focused on ""Workup and Management,"" which typically indicates a practical/clinical review rather than original research.

2. **Topic Relevance**: The article is about ""Immune-Mediated Hepatobiliary Pancreatic Toxicities That Develop During Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor Treatment."" This is specifically about checkpoint inhibitor drug-induced liver injury (ICI-DILI), not autoimmune hepatitis as a primary disease entity.

3. **Exclusion Criteria Application**:
   - Exclusion criterion #4 specifically states: ""Studies exclusively on checkpoint inhibitor drug-induced liver injury (ICI-DILI)"" should be excluded
   - The title clearly indicates this article is about toxicities that develop during immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment, which is ICI-DILI
   - Exclusion criterion #2 may also apply if this is a review/management guideline without original data (suggested by ""Workup and Management"" in the title)

4. **Inclusion Criteria Assessment**:
   - Does not appear to be original research on AIH
   - Does not appear to study AIH patients or AIH animal models
   - Focuses on drug-induced hepatotoxicity, not the pathogenesis of autoimmune hepatitis

5. **Abstract Limitation**: While the abstract is not available, the title is sufficiently clear to indicate this is about ICI-DILI management, which is explicitly excluded by the protocol.",anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929,2026-01-28T11:01:06.304122
230,[Association between high expression of intrahepatic programmed death-1 and liver inflammation in patients with autoimmune hepatitis].,,,10.3760/cma.j.issn.1007-3418.2017.04.006,include,"Let me evaluate this citation systematically against the inclusion and exclusion criteria:

**Analyzing the Title:**
- The study examines ""intrahepatic programmed death-1"" (PD-1), which is one of the checkpoint receptors explicitly listed in the inclusion criteria
- The study population is ""patients with autoimmune hepatitis"" (AIH), which matches the target population
- The study appears to investigate ""high expression"" and its ""association"" with ""liver inflammation,"" suggesting original research examining expression patterns and potentially functional roles
- The title suggests this is examining PD-1 expression in the context of AIH pathogenesis

**Checking Inclusion Criteria:**
1. Original research articles - The title suggests this is an original research study (uses ""association between"")
2. Studies examining expression of PD-1 - ✓ Yes, explicitly mentioned
3. Studies in patients with AIH - ✓ Yes, explicitly mentioned
4. Studies comparing AIH to controls - Unclear from title alone, but not required for all included studies
5. Published in English - The title appears to be translated (indicated by brackets), suggesting it may be in another language, but the English translation is provided

**Checking Exclusion Criteria:**
1. Conference abstract - Cannot determine from available information
2. Review article/editorial - Title suggests original research, not a review
3. Case report <3 patients - Unlikely given the phrasing suggests a study examining associations
4. Exclusively on ICI-DILI - No, this is about AIH patients
5. PBC/PSC without AIH - No, this is specifically about AIH

**Key Considerations:**
- Abstract is not available, making full assessment difficult
- The title clearly indicates relevance to the research question (PD-1 expression in AIH)
- Following the instruction to ""lean towards INCLUDE to avoid missing potentially relevant studies"" when information is insufficient",anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929,2026-01-28T11:01:17.089391
152,[Ctla-4 blockade: a new hope for the immunotherapy of malignant melanoma].,,,,exclude,"1. **Study Type Assessment**: The title suggests this is about CTLA-4 blockade in the context of malignant melanoma immunotherapy. The brackets around the title suggest this may be a non-English article (possibly translated title) or a review/commentary piece.

2. **Disease Focus**: The study is clearly focused on malignant melanoma, NOT autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). The inclusion criteria specifically require studies in patients with autoimmune hepatitis or animal models of AIH (Inclusion Criterion #3).

3. **Checkpoint Receptor Relevance**: While CTLA-4 is one of the checkpoint receptors of interest (Inclusion Criterion #2), the study must also meet the disease-specific criteria.

4. **Therapeutic Context**: This appears to be about CTLA-4 blockade as cancer immunotherapy for melanoma, not about the role of CTLA-4 in autoimmune hepatitis pathogenesis.

5. **Exclusion Criteria Check**:
   - The study is about melanoma, not AIH
   - No abstract is available to determine if there's any AIH-related content
   - The focus on ""immunotherapy of malignant melanoma"" clearly indicates this is cancer treatment, not autoimmune disease

6. **Missing Information**: While the abstract is not available, the title is sufficiently clear that this study is about melanoma treatment, not autoimmune hepatitis.",anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929,2026-01-28T11:01:26.105137
252,[Digital ischaemia with fingertip ulcers during ipilimumab therapy].,,,10.1016/j.annder.2019.09.606,exclude,"1. **Study Type Assessment**: The title suggests this is a case report about a patient experiencing digital ischemia with fingertip ulcers during ipilimumab therapy. The format ""[Title in brackets]"" and lack of abstract suggests this may be a brief clinical report or case presentation.

2. **Topic Relevance**:
   - Ipilimumab is an anti-CTLA-4 checkpoint inhibitor drug
   - The study appears to focus on a side effect (digital ischemia/fingertip ulcers) of checkpoint inhibitor therapy
   - There is no indication this involves autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) or liver disease

3. **Exclusion Criteria Application**:
   - The title suggests this is likely a case report with very few patients (possibly just one), which would meet exclusion criterion #3 if fewer than 3 patients
   - More importantly, this appears to be about a vascular/dermatological side effect of checkpoint inhibitor therapy, not about liver injury or AIH
   - While it involves a checkpoint inhibitor (ipilimumab/anti-CTLA-4), it does not appear to examine the expression, function, or genetic variants of checkpoint receptors in the context of AIH

4. **Inclusion Criteria Application**:
   - Does not appear to involve AIH patients or animal models of AIH (criterion #3)
   - Does not appear to compare AIH to controls (criterion #4)
   - While it involves CTLA-4 (through ipilimumab), it's about drug side effects, not the pathogenesis of AIH

5. **Missing Information**: No abstract is available, but the title is sufficiently clear about the focus being on digital ischemia as a side effect of ipilimumab therapy, not on autoimmune hepatitis.",anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929,2026-01-28T11:01:37.657948
279,[Drug-induced autoimmune-like liver injury].,,,10.1007/s00108-024-01669-4,exclude,"1. **Article Type Assessment**: The title appears to be in a foreign language (likely French or another Romance language based on the bracket format), suggesting this is a published article. However, without an abstract or additional information, I cannot determine if this is an original research article, review, editorial, or other publication type.

2. **Language**: The title is not in English, which violates inclusion criterion #5 (Published in English).

3. **Topic Relevance**: The title translates approximately to ""Drug-induced autoimmune-like liver injury."" This suggests the article is about drug-induced liver injury with autoimmune features, which appears to fall under exclusion criterion #4 (Studies exclusively on checkpoint inhibitor drug-induced liver injury (ICI-DILI)). While the exclusion criterion specifically mentions ""checkpoint inhibitor"" drug-induced liver injury, the broader context suggests studies on drug-induced liver injury (rather than primary autoimmune hepatitis) may not be the focus of this review.

4. **Checkpoint Receptor Content**: There is no indication in the title that this article examines any of the specific checkpoint receptors listed (BTLA, CTLA-4, PD-1, TIGIT, VISTA, LAG-3, CD200R).

5. **Missing Information**: The absence of an abstract, authors, year, and journal information makes it difficult to fully assess the article. However, the title alone provides sufficient information to identify likely exclusion criteria violations.

6. **Primary Concerns**:
   - Not published in English (clear exclusion)
   - Focuses on drug-induced liver injury rather than primary AIH
   - No indication of checkpoint receptor involvement",anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929,2026-01-28T11:01:47.117559
239,[Liver injury induced by immune checkpoint inhibitor-therapy : Example of an immune-mediated drug side effect].,,,10.1007/s00292-018-0519-6,exclude,"1. **Article Type Assessment**: The title suggests this is likely a review article or educational piece about immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced liver injury. The phrasing ""Example of an immune-mediated drug side effect"" suggests a descriptive or educational format rather than original research.

2. **Topic Relevance**: The article is specifically about ""liver injury induced by immune checkpoint inhibitor-therapy"" (ICI-DILI). According to Exclusion Criterion #4, ""Studies exclusively on checkpoint inhibitor drug-induced liver injury (ICI-DILI)"" should be excluded.

3. **Autoimmune Hepatitis Focus**: There is no indication in the title that this article addresses autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) specifically. The focus appears to be on drug-induced liver injury from checkpoint inhibitor therapy, which is a distinct clinical entity from primary AIH.

4. **Abstract Availability**: The abstract is not available, which creates some uncertainty. However, the title is quite explicit about the focus being on checkpoint inhibitor-induced liver injury as a drug side effect.

5. **Language**: The title appears to be in English (with possibly a German translation given the colon format), which would meet inclusion criteria if other criteria were met.

6. **Application of Exclusion Criteria**: This citation appears to fall directly under Exclusion Criterion #4 - studies exclusively on checkpoint inhibitor drug-induced liver injury. The title clearly indicates this is about ICI-DILI, not about the role of checkpoint receptors in the pathogenesis of autoimmune hepatitis.",anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929,2026-01-28T11:01:55.560923
172,[Pulse steroid therapy to treat liver injury with risk of liver failure due to immune-related adverse events:a case report].,,,10.11405/nisshoshi.118.175,exclude,"1. **Study Type Assessment**: The title indicates this is a ""case report"" about pulse steroid therapy for liver injury due to immune-related adverse events.

2. **Number of Patients**: Case reports are only excluded if they have fewer than 3 patients. The title suggests this is a single case report (singular ""case report""), which would likely be fewer than 3 patients.

3. **Topic Relevance**: The study focuses on ""immune-related adverse events"" (irAEs), which typically refers to adverse events from immune checkpoint inhibitor drugs. This falls under the exclusion criterion #4: ""Studies exclusively on checkpoint inhibitor drug-induced liver injury (ICI-DILI).""

4. **Checkpoint Receptors**: While the study involves immune-related adverse events (likely from checkpoint inhibitor therapy), it does not appear to be investigating the expression, function, or genetic variants of the specific checkpoint receptors listed (BTLA, CTLA-4, PD-1, TIGIT, VISTA, LAG-3, CD200R). Instead, it appears to focus on treatment of drug-induced liver injury.

5. **Autoimmune Hepatitis**: The study is about immune-related adverse events causing liver injury, not autoimmune hepatitis as a primary disease entity.

6. **Abstract Availability**: No abstract is available, but the title is sufficiently clear to indicate this is a case report about treating checkpoint inhibitor-induced liver injury.

7. **Language**: The title appears to be in Japanese (indicated by the brackets), though this cannot be definitively confirmed without more information.",anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929,2026-01-28T11:02:03.969616

Without an abstract or additional information, I cannot definitively determine if this is original research, a review, or commentary.

2. **Topic Relevance**: The article focuses on ""immune checkpoint inhibitor-associated liver injury"" which appears to be about drug-induced liver injury from checkpoint inhibitor therapies (ICI-DILI).

3. **Exclusion Criteria #4**: The protocol specifically excludes ""Studies exclusively on checkpoint inhibitor drug-induced liver injury (ICI-DILI)."" The title clearly indicates this article is about immune checkpoint inhibitor-associated liver injury, which is ICI-DILI.

4. **Autoimmune Hepatitis Focus**: There is no mention of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) in the title. The article appears to focus on liver injury caused by checkpoint inhibitor drugs (a form of drug-induced liver injury), not on the role of checkpoint receptors in the pathogenesis of autoimmune hepatitis.

5. **Language Consideration**: The title appears to be translated from another language (indicated by the brackets), and without confirmation that the full text is available in English, this may also fail the English language inclusion criterion.

6. **Distinction**: This study appears to be about adverse effects of checkpoint inhibitor therapy (iatrogenic liver injury), not about the role of checkpoint molecules in AIH pathogenesis, which is the focus of this review.",anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929,2026-01-28T11:02:13.080207
249,"[Study on the relationship of CTLA-4 -318, +49 polymorphisms with autoimmune hepatitis and primary biliary cirrhosis in a Chinese population].",,,,include,"Let me evaluate this citation systematically against the inclusion and exclusion criteria:

**Assessing Inclusion Criteria:**

1. **Original research articles**: The title suggests this is an original research study examining polymorphisms, which typically indicates original research rather than a review.

2. **Studies examining expression, function, or genetic variants of checkpoint receptors**: YES - The study explicitly examines CTLA-4 polymorphisms (genetic variants at positions -318 and +49), which is one of the specified checkpoint receptors.

3. **Studies in patients with autoimmune hepatitis or animal models**: YES - The title explicitly mentions ""autoimmune hepatitis"" in a Chinese population.

4. **Studies comparing AIH to healthy controls or other liver disease controls**: The study appears to examine both AIH and primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), suggesting comparative analysis.

5. **Published in English**: UNCERTAIN - The title appears to be translated from Chinese (indicated by the brackets), but the actual publication language is unclear.

**Assessing Exclusion Criteria:**

1. **Conference abstracts without full text**: Cannot determine from the information provided.

2. **Review articles, editorials, commentaries, letters**: The title structure suggests original research on polymorphisms, not a review.

3. **Case reports with fewer than 3 patients**: Unlikely - population genetic studies typically involve larger sample sizes.

4. **Studies exclusively on checkpoint inhibitor drug-induced liver injury**: NO - This is about genetic polymorphisms in AIH, not drug-induced injury.

5. **Studies on PBC or PSC without AIH comparison**: NO - The study explicitly includes AIH as one of the conditions being studied.

**Key Considerations:**
- The abstract is not available, making full assessment difficult
- However, the title clearly indicates this is a study of CTLA-4 genetic variants in AIH patients
- This directly addresses the review's interest in genetic associations of checkpoint receptors in AIH
- Following the high sensitivity approach when information is limited",anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929,2026-01-28T11:02:23.945832
