# Systematic Review: Inhibitory Checkpoint Receptors in Autoimmune Hepatitis

**Review name:** aih-hepatitis
**Generated:** 2026-01-28 13:51

## Objective

To systematically review the evidence on whether inhibitory checkpoint
receptors (BTLA, CTLA-4, PD-1, TIGIT, VISTA, LAG-3, CD200R) and their
ligands are involved in the pathogenesis of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH),
including their expression patterns, functional roles, genetic associations,
and potential as therapeutic targets.
